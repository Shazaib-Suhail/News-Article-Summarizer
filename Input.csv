House Republicans Fret About Winning Their Health Care Suit - The New York Times,New York Times,Carl Hulse,12/31/2016,2016,12,,"WASHINGTON Congressional Republicans have a new fear when it comes to their health care lawsuit against the Obama administration: They might win. The incoming Trump administration could choose to no longer defend the executive branch against the suit, which challenges the administration's authority to spend billions of dollars on health insurance subsidies for and Americans, handing House Republicans a big victory on issues. But a sudden loss of the disputed subsidies could conceivably cause the health care program to implode, leaving millions of people without access to health insurance before Republicans have prepared a replacement. That could lead to chaos in the insurance market and spur a political backlash just as Republicans gain full control of the government. To stave off that outcome, Republicans could find themselves in the awkward position of appropriating huge sums to temporarily prop up the Obama health care law, angering conservative voters who have been demanding an end to the law for years. In another twist, Donald J. Trumps administration, worried about preserving executive branch prerogatives, could choose to fight its Republican allies in the House on some central questions in the dispute. Eager to avoid an ugly political pileup, Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Trump transition team are gaming out how to handle the lawsuit, which, after the election, has been put in limbo until at least late February by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They are not yet ready to divulge their strategy. Given that this pending litigation involves the Obama administration and Congress, it would be inappropriate to comment, said Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition effort. Upon taking office, the Trump administration will evaluate this case and all related aspects of the Affordable Care Act.  In a potentially decision in 2015, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that House Republicans had the standing to sue the executive branch over a spending dispute and that the Obama administration had been distributing the health insurance subsidies, in violation of the Constitution, without approval from Congress. The Justice Department, confident that Judge Collyers decision would be reversed, quickly appealed, and the subsidies have remained in place during the appeal. In successfully seeking a temporary halt in the proceedings after Mr. Trump won, House Republicans last month told the court that they and the s transition team currently are discussing potential options for resolution of this matter, to take effect after the s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017.  The suspension of the case, House lawyers said, will provide the and his future administration time to consider whether to continue prosecuting or to otherwise resolve this appeal.  Republican leadership officials in the House acknowledge the possibility of cascading effects if the payments, which have totaled an estimated $13 billion, are suddenly stopped. Insurers that receive the subsidies in exchange for paying costs such as deductibles and for eligible consumers could race to drop coverage since they would be losing money. Over all, the loss of the subsidies could destabilize the entire program and cause a lack of confidence that leads other insurers to seek a quick exit as well. Anticipating that the Trump administration might not be inclined to mount a vigorous fight against the House Republicans given the s dim view of the health care law, a team of lawyers this month sought to intervene in the case on behalf of two participants in the health care program. In their request, the lawyers predicted that a deal between House Republicans and the new administration to dismiss or settle the case will produce devastating consequences for the individuals who receive these reductions, as well as for the nations health insurance and health care systems generally.  No matter what happens, House Republicans say, they want to prevail on two overarching concepts: the congressional power of the purse, and the right of Congress to sue the executive branch if it violates the Constitution regarding that spending power. House Republicans contend that Congress never appropriated the money for the subsidies, as required by the Constitution. In the suit, which was initially championed by John A. Boehner, the House speaker at the time, and later in House committee reports, Republicans asserted that the administration, desperate for the funding, had required the Treasury Department to provide it despite widespread internal skepticism that the spending was proper. The White House said that the spending was a permanent part of the law passed in 2010, and that no annual appropriation was required even though the administration initially sought one. Just as important to House Republicans, Judge Collyer found that Congress had the standing to sue the White House on this issue a ruling that many legal experts said was flawed and they want that precedent to be set to restore congressional leverage over the executive branch. But on spending power and standing, the Trump administration may come under pressure from advocates of presidential authority to fight the House no matter their shared views on health care, since those precedents could have broad repercussions. It is a complicated set of dynamics illustrating how a quick legal victory for the House in the Trump era might come with costs that Republicans never anticipated when they took on the Obama White House."
Rift Between Officers and Residents as Killings Persist in South Bronx - The New York Times,New York Times,Benjamin Mueller and Al Baker,6/19/2017,2017,6,,"After the bullet shells get counted, the blood dries and the votive candles burn out, people peer down from windows and see crime scenes gone cold: a band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze. The South Bronx, just across the Harlem River from Manhattan and once shorthand for urban dysfunction, still suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of New York City. And yet the citys efforts to fight it remain splintered, underfunded and burdened by scandal. In the 40th Precinct, at the southern tip of the Bronx, as in other poor, minority neighborhoods across the country, people long hounded for infractions are crying out for more protection against grievous injury or death. By September, four of every five shootings in the precinct this year were unsolved. Out of the citys 77 precincts, the 40th has the highest murder rate but the fewest detectives per violent crime, reflecting disparities in staffing that hit hardest in some neighborhoods outside Manhattan, according to a New York Times analysis of Police Department data. Investigators in the precinct are saddled with twice the number of cases the department recommends, even as their bosses are called to Police Headquarters to answer for the sharpest crime rise in the city this year. And across the Bronx, investigative resources are squeezed. It has the highest rate of the citys five boroughs but the thinnest detective staffing. Nine of the 14 precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there. The boroughs robbery squad is smaller than Manhattans, even though the Bronx has had 1, 300 more cases this year. And its homicide squad has one detective for every four murders, compared with one detective for roughly every two murders in Upper Manhattan and more than one detective per murder in Lower Manhattan. In lobbies and family apartments, outside methadone clinics and art studios, people take note of the inequity. They hear police commanders explain that they lack the resources to place a floodlight on a dangerous block or to post officers at a corner. They watch witnesses cower behind doors, more fearful of a gunmans crew than confident in the Police Departments ability to protect them. So though people see a lot, they rarely testify. And in the South Bronx, as in so many predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods like it in the United States, the contract between the police and the community is in tatters. Some people have stories of crime reports that were ignored, or 911 calls that went unanswered for hours. Others tell of a 911 call for help ending in the callers arrest, or of a minor charge leading to 12 hours in a fetid holding cell. This is the paradox of policing in the 40th Precinct. Its neighborhoods have historically been prime targets for aggressive tactics, like that are designed to ward off disorder. But precinct detectives there have less time than anywhere else in the city to answer for the blood spilled in violent crimes. Gola White, who was beside her daughter when she was shot and killed in a playground this summer, four years after her son was gunned down in the same housing project, ticked off the public safety resources that she said were scant in Bronx neighborhoods like hers: security cameras, lights, locks, investigating police officers. Here, we have nothing, she said. When it comes to families, she said, the authorities dont really care as much. Thats how I feel. The Times has been documenting the murders logged this year in the 40th Precinct, one of a handful of neighborhoods where deadly violence remains a problem in an era of crime in New York City. The homicides 14 in the precinct this year, up from nine in 2015 strain detectives, and when they go unsolved, as half of them have this year, some look to take the law into their own hands. From hundreds of conversations with grieving relatives and friends, witnesses and police officers, the social forces that flare into murder in a place like the 40th Precinct become clearer: merciless gang codes, mental illness, drugs and long memories of feuds that simmered out of officers view. The reasons some murders will never be solved also emerge: paralyzing fear of retribution, victims carrying secrets to their graves and relentless casework that forces detectives to move on in hopes that a break will come later. Frustrations build on all sides. Detectives phones rarely ring with tips, and officers grow embittered with witnesses who will not cooperate. In the meantime, a victims friends conduct their own investigations, and talk of grabbing a stash gun from a wheel well or a mothers apartment when they find their suspect. In the chasm between the police and the community, gangs and gun violence flourish. Parents try to protect their families from drug crews threats, and officers work to overcome the residue of years of mistrust and understaffing in communities where they still go racing from one 911 call to the next. The streets around St. Marys Park were the scene of two fatal shootings logged in the 40th Precinct this year. Both are unsolved. James Fernandez heard talk of the murders through the door of his apartment on East 146th Street in a the Betances Houses. He lived at the end of a long hallway strewn with hypodermic needles, empty dope bags and discarded Hennessy bottles. A young men who spoke of being in a subset of the Bloods gang had made it their drug market, slinging marijuana and cocaine to regulars, flashing firearms and blowing smoke into the Fernandez apartment. When Mr. Fernandez, 40, asked the young men to move, they answered by busting up his car. This kind of crime, an anachronism in much of New York, still rattles the 40th Precinct, even though murders there have fallen to 14 this year from 83 in 1991. It has more major felony crimes per resident than any other residential district in the city. It is also one of the poorest communities in the country, and many young men find their way into underground markets. Mr. Fernandez was not one to shrink from the threats. When he was growing up on the Lower East Side, he rode his bicycle around to the customers of the drug dealers he worked for and collected payments in a backpack. After leaving that life, he got a tech maintenance job and, three years ago, moved into the Betances Houses with his wife and daughter, now 11. He had two choices to get help with the drug crew: call the police for help and risk being labeled a snitch, or call his old Lower East Side bosses for muscle and risk violence. He chose the police. Again and again, he walked into a local substation, Police Service Area 7, and asked for protection. His daughter was using an inhaler to relieve coughs from the marijuana smoke. Mr. Fernandez and his wife got terrible headaches. Theres a lot of killers here, and we are going to kill you, a sergeants police report quoted a telling Mr. Fernandez in August 2015. A second report filed the same day said a warned him, Im going to shoot through your window. Mr. Fernandez told the police both the teenagers names, which appear in the reports, and then went home. He said one of their friends had seen him walk into the substation, and they tried to intimidate him out of filing another report. Three days later, the same propped his bike on their door, then said if I was to open the door and say something, they would body slam me, Mr. Fernandezs wife, Maria Fernandez, wrote on slips of paper she used to document the hallway ruckus and the inadequate police response. The boys made comments about how easy a target she was and about how they would have to slap her if she opened the door while they made a drug sale, and they threatened to beat the Fernandez family because they are the ones snitching, her notes say. But another complaint at the substation, 10 days after the first, brought no relief. A week later, feeling desperate, Ms. Fernandez tried calling: first to the substation, at 8:50 p. m. when one of the boys blew weed smoke at her door and made a threat to attack her, and then to 911 at 10:36 p. m. The police never came, she wrote in her notes. She tried the 40th Precinct station house next, but officers at the desk left her standing in the public waiting area for a she said, making her fear being seen again. Officers put her in worse danger some months later, she said, when they came to her door and announced in front of the teenagers that they were there on a complaint about drug activity. Mr. Fernandez started doing the work that he said the police had failed to do. He wired a camera into his peephole to record the drugs and guns. The footage hark back to the New York of the 1980s, still very much present to some of the precincts residents. Around 6:30 each morning, Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo walks through the tall wooden doors of the 40th Precinct station house. The cases that land on his metal desk dead bodies with no known cause, strip club brawls, shooting victims hobbling into the hospital themselves bring resistance at every turn, reminding him of an earlier era in the citys campaign. I havent got one single phone call thats putting me in the right direction here, said Sergeant LoPuzzo, the head of the precincts detective squad, one day this summer as he worked on an answer to an email inquiry from a murder victims aunt about why the killer had not been caught. And people just dont understand that. Often it is detectives who most feel the effects of people turning on the police. Witnesses shout them away from their doors just so neighbors know they refuse to talk. Of the 184 people who were shot and wounded in the Bronx through early September, more than a third 66 victims refused to cooperate. Over the same period in the 40th Precinct, squad detectives closed three of 17 nonfatal shootings, and 72 of 343 robbery cases. Part of the resistance stems from preventive policing tactics, like that were a hallmark of the style under former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly. Near the height of the strategy, in 2012, the 40th Precinct had the stops in the city, the stops in which officers used force and the most frisks. Of 18, 276 stops that year, 15, 521 were of people who had done nothing criminal. The precinct was also one of the areas that the department flooded with its newest officers. At roll calls, they were pressured to generate numbers: write tickets and make arrests. They had no choice but to give a summons to a young man playing in a park after dark, even if the officers had done the same growing up in the same neighborhood. I need to bring something in today to justify my existence, Officer Argenis Rosado, who joined the precinct in 2010, said in an interview at the station house. So now youre in a small area, and day after day youre hammering the same community. Of course that communitys eventually going to turn on you. The pressure warped the way officers and residents saw each other. Rookies had to ignore why someone might be drinking outside or sitting on a stoop. Some of the cops that came out at that time probably viewed the community differently, too, said Hector Espada, a veteran of the precinct. Not because they wanted to, but because they had to. Because some way or somehow, you cant give someone a $115 summons and feel like you guys could still have a civil conversation after that. Morale wilted in the aged station house on Alexander Avenue, in Mott Haven. Officers felt pressure to downgrade crime complaints to make them appear less serious. Several said in interviews that they had overlooked crime reports from immigrants because they were seen as unlikely to complain, and watched supervisors badger victims into repeating their stories in hopes that they would drop their complaints. The practice of downgrading complaints resulted in the disciplining of 19 officers in the precinct last year, one in a string of scandals that has left officers there feeling overscrutinized for problems that also existed elsewhere. Four commanders in the precinct were sent packing in five years, one of them after officers were found to be ticket fixing, or forgiving parking tickets for friends, and another after he was recorded giving guidance on whom to stop and frisk: black boys and men, ages 14 to 21. Some officers fled to other commands. Others became reluctant to take assignments in proactive policing units, like that put them in situations on the street. Whenever I walked through the doors of the precinct, to me, it seemed like a black cloud, said Russell Lewis, a of the 40th. It was like a heaviness. When you walked in, all you wanted to do was do your 8 hours 35 minutes and go home, because you didnt want to get caught up in anything. The precinct covers only about two square miles, but the more than a dozen housing projects there mean that it overflows with people. Methadone clinics draw addicts from around the city. lofts on the southern edge of the precinct presage a wave of gentrification. Even as the Police Department has hired 1, 300 more officers for neighborhood policing and counterterrorism, officers in the 40th Precinct said they could still rush to 25 911 calls during a shift a number unchanged from what the new police commissioner, James P. ONeill, said he was handling in a similar South Bronx precinct 15 years ago. Several dozen calls at a time can be waiting for a response. Residents know that if you want the police for a domestic problem, it helps to hint that there is a weapon. Last year, the precinct drew the number of civilian complaints for officer misconduct in the city, and the most lawsuits stemming from police actions. The precinct is trying to improve morale under a new commanding officer, Deputy Inspector Brian Hennessy. A cadre of what the department calls neighborhood coordination officers has been on patrol since last January, part of a citywide effort under Mr. ONeill and Mayor Bill de Blasio to bring back the beat cop, unencumbered by chasing every last 911 call, who can listen to peoples concerns and help with investigations. The precinct has made among the most gun arrests in the city, and officers said they now had more discretion to resolve encounters without a summons or an arrest. At one corner near a school, on Courtlandt Avenue and East 151st Street, that has long spawned complaints about gunfire and fights, Inspector Hennessy and some of his officers painted over graffiti and swept up drug paraphernalia this summer. People said it was the first answer to their complaints in years. But the inspector acknowledged that the residue of policing lingers. That perception really sticks, he said. The workload in the 40th Precinct is startling and reveals a gap in how detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in Manhattan compared with the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. Three of the precincts 16 detectives are carrying more than 400 cases each this year, and many others have loads in the high 300s, even though the department advises 150 in violent precincts. When they are assigned a homicide, they typically have four days to investigate before dealing with other cases. Quieter precincts can give detectives a month with little distraction to investigate a murder. Detectives in the 40th Precinct have each handled an average of 79 violent felonies this year through murders, rapes, felony assaults and robberies. By contrast, a detective in the precinct on the southern end of Staten Island carries nine such cases a detective in the precinct patrolling Union Square and Gramercy Park handles 16 and a detective in the precinct for most of Washington Heights handles 32, the citywide median. Last year, the 40th was the for violent crime, with 65 cases per detective. In the Bronx as a whole, a precinct detective has carried an average of 58 violent felonies this year, compared with 27 in Manhattan, 37 in Brooklyn, 38 in Queens and 25 on Staten Island. Rape cases and robbery patterns are later sent to more specialized units, but precinct detectives do extensive initial work to interview victims, write reports and process evidence. Precincts in much of Manhattan, which are whiter and wealthier than the South Bronx, often have more property felonies, like stolen laptops or credit cards, and the police say those can be complex. But even accounting for those crimes, the 40th Precinct has some of the heaviest caseloads of overall crime per detective in the city. Michael Palladino, the head of the Detectives Endowment Association and a former Bronx officer, said staffing disparities affected the departments efforts to build trust in communities like the South Bronx. Witnesses make a calculation, he said: If I cooperate with the detectives, theres so much work, theres so few of them there, they wont even get the chance to protect me, or theyll be there too late when the retaliation comes. Sergeant LoPuzzo, who turned down a more prestigious post to stay in the 40th Precinct, said that his squad worked tirelessly to handle cases with the people he had, and that while every squad wanted more detectives, staffing needs for counterterrorism units and task forces had created new deployment challenges across the department. We fight with the army we have, not the army we wish we had, he said. Details of how the Police Department assigns its 36, 000 officers are closely held and constantly in flux, and the public has minimal information on how personnel are allocated. Presented with The Timess analysis of confidential staffing data, the departments chief of detectives, Robert K. Boyce, vowed to send more detectives to the 40th Precinct and said the department would reassess its deployment more broadly in troubled precincts. He said a recent decision to bring gang, narcotics and vice detectives under his command made it easier to shift personnel. Chief Boyce said the burdens on detectives went beyond felony crimes to include and cases. And he noted the support that precinct squads got from centralized units focusing on robberies, gangs or grand larcenies, for example. Major crime keeps pounding the 40th Precinct, at rates that in 2015 were only a tenth of a percent lower than in 2001, even as citywide crime dropped by more than a third over the same period. But the precincts detective squad shrank by about eight investigators during those years, according to staffing data obtained from the City Council through a Freedom of Information Law request. The squad covering Union Square and Gramercy Park, where crime dropped by a third over that period, grew by about 11 investigators. (The 40th Precinct was given an additional detective and four investigators this summer, when it was already missing three detectives for illness or other reasons.) Retired detectives are skeptical that community relations alone can drive down crime in the citys last the busiest precincts. Rather, they say, the Police Department should be dedicating more resources to providing the same sort of robust investigative response that seems standard in Manhattan. Any crime in Manhattan has to be solved, said Howard Landesberg, who was a 40th Precinct detective in the late 1980s. The outer boroughs are, like, forgotten. Retired detectives said that understaffing made it harder to solve crimes in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, where the higher prevalence of gang and drug killings already saddled investigators with cases in which people were not inclined to cooperate. Through detectives had closed 67 percent of homicides in Manhattan and 76 percent of those in Staten Island this year, compared with 54 percent of those in the Bronx, 42 percent of those in Queens and 31 percent of those in Brooklyn. Of last years homicides, detectives cleared 71 percent in Manhattan, 63 percent in the Bronx, 62 percent in Queens, 57 percent in Staten Island and 31 percent in Brooklyn. Its the culture of the Police Department that they worry about Manhattan, said Joseph L. Giacalone, a former sergeant in the Bronx Cold Case Squad, in part because thats where the money is. He added: When de Blasio came in, he talked about the tale of two cities. And then hes done the complete opposite of what he said. Its just business as usual. The Bronxs struggles extend into prosecutions. In each of the last five years, prosecutors in the Bronx have declined to prosecute violent felony cases more than anywhere else in the city. And the rate of conviction in the Bronx is routinely the lowest in the city as well, but has ticked up this year to surpass Brooklyns rate through November as Bronx prosecutors work to streamline cases. Some cases have become even more difficult to win because of the problem in the 40th Precinct, which has allowed defense lawyers to attack the credibility of officers who were implicated, said Patrice OShaughnessy, a spokeswoman for the Bronx District Attorneys office. The district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, elected in 2015, said in a statement, I was a judge here in the Bronx, and I heard from jurors that they cant be impartial because they dont trust the police. Against that tide of mistrust, Sergeant LoPuzzos detectives work 36 hours straight on some fresh cases. They buy Chinese takeout with their own money for a murder suspect. They carry surveillance videos home in hopes that their personal computers may enhance them better than a squad computer. They buy an urn for a homeless mother who has her murdered sons ashes in a box. In the months after a killing, they can seem like the only people in this glittering city who are paying attention to the 40th Precincts homicide victims. Newly fatherless children go back to school without a therapists help. Victims families wander confused through a courthouse and nearly miss an appearance. Newspapers largely ignore killings of people with criminal pasts, pushing them down the priority lists of the chiefs at Police Headquarters. In a stuffy squad room, the detectives of the 40th Precinct grapple with an inheritance of government neglect. They meet mothers who believe their sons might never have been murdered had a city guidance counselor listened to pleas to help them stay enrolled, or had a city housing worker fixed the locks or lights on a building. And the detectives work alongside a vicious system on the streets for punishing police cooperators. Young men scan court paperwork in prison, looking for the names of people who turned on them. One murder victim in the precinct this year was cast out of his crew after he avoided being arrested with them in a gang takedown some believed he was cooperating. A longtime 40th Precinct detective, Jeff Meenagh, said a witness in a homicide case was going to testify until he went back to his neighborhood and was told that anyone who testified would get what you deserve. The allies Sergeant LoPuzzo makes are friendly only for so long. He helped clear a womans son of a robbery charge by locating surveillance video that proved he was not the robber. The mother started calling with tips under a code name about a gun under a car, for example. But she always refused to testify. And she cut ties this year after Sergeant LoPuzzo arrested her son in the stabbing of two people and her in a shooting. New York City owns East 146th Street and the buildings on each side. But James Fernandez, in the Betances Houses, said the reality on the ground was different: The drug boss ran the block. By October, Mr. Fernandez was increasingly afraid and fed up. Mr. Fernandez and his wife went so far as to give officers keys to the building door, so they could get in whenever they wanted, showed them the videos and offered them access to his camera so they could see what was happening in the hallway. A couple of officers said they needed a supervisors permission to do more. Others answered that the young men were only making threats. Officers occasionally stopped outside their building, causing the young men to scatter, but did not come inside, Mr. Fernandez said. The menacing worsened. Mr. Fernandezs daughter was harassed as she arrived home from school. She grew more and more distressed, and her parents had her start seeing a therapist. Mr. Fernandez made several complaints at the office of the borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr. and visited a victims advocate in the district attorneys office. On Oct. 20, 2015, he sent an online note to the police commissioners office. We went to all proper channels for help, the note said. Both precincts failed us, except 2 officers who helped us, but their hands are tied. No one else to turn to. I have months of video of multiple crimes taking place and we are in extreme danger. 40th and PSA 7 wont do anything, he wrote, referring to the local substation. Please we need to speak to some one with authority. The local substation commander, Deputy Inspector Jerry OSullivan, and the Bronx narcotics unit were alerted to the complaints. But Mr. Fernandez said he never heard from them. So he relied on his own street instincts to protect his family. He made pleas to a man he thought was employing the dealers in the hallway. The activity quieted briefly, but it returned after the young men rented a room in a womans apartment upstairs. Mr. Fernandez approached a different man who he learned was the boss of the operation. The man agreed to ask the dealers to calm down. He even hired a drug customer to sweep the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said. But two weeks later, the dealing and the harassment resumed. So he went to his old Lower East Side bosses, who hired men to trail his wife and daughter on their way out of the building and make sure they made it safely to school. At other times they sat outside the Betances Houses. He also bought two bulletproof vests, for about $700 each. He could not find one small enough for his daughter. I have no faith in the City of New York, I have no faith in the police, I have no faith in the politicians, Mr. Fernandez said. The only thing I know for sure: God, if were in a situation again, I will be left to defend my family. Paying such close attention to what was happening in the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said he learned some details about two recent homicides that the 40th Precinct was investigating. But because his calls for help were going nowhere, he said he decided not to put himself in greater risk by talking: He would not tell the police what he had learned. Im bending over backward, and nobodys not even doing anything, he said. Why am I going to help you, if you aint going to help me? By last January, a new neighborhood coordination officer was working with residents of the Betances Houses, and ended up with the most arrests in his housing command, Inspector OSullivan said. Chief Boyce said that the silos in which gang and narcotics detectives used to work made responding to complaints more difficult, but that the recent restructuring would remove those obstacles. No one should live like Mr. Fernandez lived, with people dealing drugs outside of his apartment, he said. Mr. Fernandezs complaints did not spur any arrests, but two men from the hallway were caught separately this year in shootings. One of them, whom Mr. Fernandez named in a police report, was charged this summer with hitting an officer with a metal folding chair and firing three gunshots into a crowd, court papers say. He is being held on Rikers Island on an attempted murder charge. That was too late for Mr. Fernandez. By May, he had moved his family away."
"Among Deaths in 2016, a Heavy Toll in Pop Music - The New York Times",New York Times,William McDonald,4/10/2017,2017,4,,"Death may be the great equalizer, but it isnt necessarily evenhanded. Of all the fields of endeavor that suffered mortal losses in 2016 consider Muhammad Ali and Arnold Palmer in sports and the Hollywood deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds the pop music world had, hands down, the bleakest year. Start with David Bowie, whose stage persona androgynous glam rocker, dance pop star, electronic experimentalist was as as his music. The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69. He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album, released just two days before his death, but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public, a wish for privacy that ensured that his death would appear to have come out of the blue. Then came another shock, about three months later, when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near Minneapolis. Death came to him at 57, and by all indications no one, including Prince Rogers Nelson, had seen it coming. As energetic onstage as ever, holding to an otherwise healthy regimen, he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade, so why not death, too? Leonard Cohen, on the other hand, in his 83rd year, undoubtedly did see it coming, just over his shoulder, but he went on his I hesitate to say merry way, ever the wise, troubadour playing to sellout crowds and shrugging at the inevitable, knowing that the dark would finally overtake him but saying essentially, Until then, heres another song.  It was as if 2016 hadnt delivered enough jolts to the system when it closed out the year with yet another death. George Michael, the 1980s sensation whose aura had dimmed in later years, was 53 when he went to bed and never woke up on Christmas. Pop music figures fell all year, many of their voices still embedded in the nicked vinyl grooves of old records that a lot of people cant bear to throw out. The roster included Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane Keith Emerson and Greg Lake of Emerson, Lake and Palmer Glenn Frey of the Eagles and Maurice White of Earth, Wind Fire. Leon Russell, the piano pounder with a Delta blues wail and a mountain mans mass of hair, died. So did Merle Haggard, rugged country poet of the common man and the outlaw. He was joined by the bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley and the guitar virtuoso who was practically glued to Elviss swiveling hips in the early days: Scotty Moore. And then there was George Martin, whose genius had such a creative influence on the sounds of John, Paul, George and Ringo (and, by extension, on the entire rock era) that he was hailed as the fifth Beatle. If the music stars could fill arenas, so could idols of another stripe: the mighty athletes who left the scene. No figure among them was as towering as Ali. Some called him the greatest sports figure of the 20th century, the boxer who combined power, grace and brains in a way the ring had never seen. But he was more than a great athlete. Matters of war, race and religion coursed through his life in a publicly turbulent way. Some people hated him when he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War, a decision that cost him his heavyweight title. But more people admired him, even loved him, for his principled stands, his high spirits, his lightning mind, his winking and, yes, his rhyming motormouth. Until illness closed in, little could contain him, certainly not mere ropes around a ring. Palmer, too, was transformational, golfs first media star. The gentlemans game was never quite the same after he began gathering an army on the rolling greenswards and leading a charge, his shirt coming untucked, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his club just that, a weapon, as he pressed the attack. An entire generation of postwar guys took up the game because of Arnie, and not a few women did, too. He was athletically blessed, magnetically cool, telegenically handsome but he was somehow one of them, too. The same was said of Gordie Howe, Mr. Hockey, a son of the Saskatchewan prairie who tore up the National Hockey League, hung up his skates at 52 and died at 88 and of Ralph Branca, a trolley car conductors son who was a living reminder that one crushing mistake his, the fastball to Bobby Thomson that decided the 1951 National League pennant can sometimes never be lived down. Pat Summitt, the coach who elevated womens basketball, led her Tennessee teams to eight championships and won more games than any other college coach, could not defeat Alzheimers disease, dying at 64. And within months the National Basketball Association lost two giants from different eras. Clyde Lovelette, an Olympic, college and N. B. A. champion who transformed the game as one of its first truly big men, was 86 his hardwood heir Nate Thurmond, a defensive stalwart who battled Russell, Wilt and Kareem in the paint in a Hall of Fame career, was 74. Even older, in the baseball ranks, was Monte Irvin. When he died at 96, there were few people still around who could remember watching him play, particularly in his prime, in the 1940s, when he was a star on the Negro circuit but barred from the major leagues. He made the Hall of Fame anyway as a New York Giant and became Major League Baseballs first black executive, but when he died, fans pondered again the question that has hung over many an athletic career shackled by discrimination: What if? A different question, in an entirely different sphere, arose after the stunning news that Justice Antonin Scalia had died on a hunting trip in Texas: What now? In the thick of one of the most consequential Supreme Court careers of modern times, he left a void in conservative jurisprudence and, more urgently, a vacancy on the bench that has yet to be filled, raising still more questions about what may await the country. Other exits from the public stage returned us to the past. Nancy Reagans death evoked the 1980s White House, where glamour and West Coast conservatism took up residence on the banks of the Potomac. John Glenns had us thinking again about a burst of national pride soaring into outer space. The deaths of Tom Hayden and Daniel Berrigan, avatars of defiance, harked back to the student rebellions of the 1960s and the Vietnam Wars roiling home front. Phyllis Schlaflys obituaries were windows on the roots of the right wings ascension in American politics. The death of Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as attorney general, recalled the Clinton years, all eight of them, from the firestorm at Waco, Tex. to the international tug of war over a Cuban boy named EliÃ¡n GonzÃ¡lez, to the bitter Senate battle over impeachment. On other shores, Fidel Castros death at 90 summoned memories of Cuban revolution, nuclear brinkmanship and enduring enmity between a strongman and the superpower only 90 miles away. The name of Boutros the Egyptian diplomat who led the United Nations, led to replayed nightmares of genocide in Rwanda and Bosnia. The death of Shimon Peres removed a last link to the very founding of Israel and conjured decades of growing military power and fitful strivings for peace. And that of Elie Wiesel, in New York, after his tireless struggle to compel the world never to forget, made us confront once again the gas chambers of Auschwitz. If writers, too, are even in fiction, then the world is poorer without the literary voices of Harper Lee, Umberto Eco, Pat Conroy, Jim Harrison, Anita Brookner, Alvin Toffler, Gloria Naylor and William Trevor, not to mention the playwrights Peter Shaffer, Dario Fo and, Edward Albee all dead in 2016. But just as treasured were those who spun for our viewing pleasure none more lustily than Ms. Fisher, the Princess Leia of the Star Wars tales. Just a day later, capping a year of startling deaths, Ms. Reynolds, a singing and acting leading lady of an earlier era, died at 84 in the throes of a mothers grief. Devotees of the Harry Potter movies were saddened by the death of Alan Rickman, who played the deliciously dour professor Severus Snape in that blockbuster franchise but whose career, on both stage and screen, was far richer than many of Snapes younger fans may have known. Zsa Zsa Gabors celebrity, by contrast, outshone a modest acting career. Gene Wilder and Garry Shandling died in the same year, both having perfected a brand of hilariously neurotic comedy fit for a culture. And this time Abe Vigoda, of the Godfather movies and Barney Miller, actually did die, after having not actually done so years ago when wildly uninformed people spread the word that he had. On the other side of the camera were directors whose vision came to us from all parts: Jacques Rivette, the French New Wave auteur, with his meditations on life and art Abbas Kiarostami, the Iranian master, with his searching examinations of ordinary lives Andrzej Wajda, a rival to Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa in some critics eyes, with his haunting tales of Poland under the boot first of Nazis and then of Communists. A long roster of television stars of a generation or two ago passed on, images of their younger selves frozen in time: Noel Neill (Adventures of Superman) Alan Young (Mister Ed) Robert Vaughn (The Man From U. N. C. L. E. ) William Schallert and Patty Duke (father and daughter on The Patty Duke Show) Dan Haggerty (The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams) Florence Henderson (The Brady Bunch) and Alan Thicke (Growing Pains). And Garry Marshall, the creative force who practically owned prime time with Happy Days, Mork Mindy, Laverne Shirley and more, died at 81. On Broadway, lights were dimmed in memory of Brian Bedford, Tammy Grimes and Anne Jackson, all brilliant in their day. The architect Zaha Hadid left behind monuments to her fertile imagination and shaken acolytes around the world. The street photographer Bill Cunningham, who found fashion statements on every corner, was suddenly missing, making Manhattan, overnight, a less idiosyncratic, less interesting place. That smiling skinny man pedaling his bicycle among the honking cabs in a blue French workers jacket with a camera slung around his neck what a picture! had split from the scene. So had seemingly a generation of fellow photographers who had made art in recording the last half of the 20th century: Ruth Gruber, Marc Riboud, Louis Stettner and more. And so had the TV journalists Morley Safer and Gwen Ifill and the TV commentator John McLaughlin, all of whom had tried to make sense of it. Musics other precincts were emptier without the conductor and revolutionary composer Pierre Boulez and the new music soprano Phyllis Curtin the jazz artists Mose Allison, Bobby Hutcherson and Gato Barbieri the rapper Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor) and the Latin megastar Juan Gabriel. Silicon Valley saw a giant depart in Andrew S. Grove, who led the semiconductor revolution at Intel. The television industry lost a executive, Grant Tinker, who in the 80s made NBC the network to watch in prime time. Astrophysics, and the smaller world of women in science, said farewell to a pioneer and a champion in Vera Rubin. And for tens of thousands of people who might have choked to death had they not been saved by his simple but ingenious maneuver, the passing of Henry J. Heimlich prompted not just sympathy but, even more, gratitude. Come to think of it, eliciting a large, if silent, thank you from those who live on is not a bad way for anyone to go. Which brings us to Marion Pritchard. Few who died in 2016 could have inspired measures of gratitude more profound. She was a brave young Dutch student and a gentile who risked her life to save Jews from death camps in the early 1940s, in one instance shooting a Nazi stooge before he could seize three little children she had been hiding. By her estimate she saved 150 people. How many were still alive when she died a few weeks ago at 96 is anyones guess. But we know for certain that some were, and we can reasonably surmise that a good many more were, too, all of them still in possession of her selfless gift and her matchless legacy, their very lives."
Kim Jong-un Says North Korea Is Preparing to Test Long-Range Missile - The New York Times,New York Times,Choe Sang-Hun,1/2/2017,2017,1,,"SEOUL, South Korea North Koreas leader, Kim said on Sunday that his country was making final preparations to conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile a bold statement less than a month before the inauguration of Donald J. Trump. Although North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests in the last decade and more than 20 ballistic missile tests in 2016 alone, and although it habitually threatens to attack the United States with nuclear weapons, the country has never an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. In his annual New Years Day speech, which was broadcast on the Norths KCTV on Sunday, Mr. Kim spoke proudly of the strides he said his country had made in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. He said North Korea would continue to bolster its weapons programs as long as the United States remained hostile and continued its joint military exercises with South Korea. We have reached the final stage in preparations to an intercontinental ballistic rocket, he said. Analysts in the region have said Mr. Kim might conduct another weapons test in coming months, taking advantage of leadership changes in the United States and South Korea. Mr. Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20. In South Korea, President Park whose powers were suspended in a Parliamentary impeachment on Dec. 9, is waiting for the Constitutional Court to rule on whether she should be formally removed from office or reinstated. If North Korea conducts a test in coming months, it will test Mr. Trumps new administration despite years of increasingly harsh sanctions, North Korea has been advancing toward Mr. Kims professed goal of arming his isolated country with the ability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States. Mr. Kims speech on Sunday indicated that North Korea may a rocket several times this year to complete its ICBM program, said Cheong a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. The first of such tests could come even before Mr. Trumps inauguration, Mr. Cheong said. We need to take note of the fact that this is the first New Years speech where Kim mentioned an intercontinental ballistic missile, he said. In his speech, Mr. Kim did not comment on Mr. Trumps election. Doubt still runs deep that North Korea has mastered all the technology needed to build a reliable ICBM. But analysts in the region said the Norths launchings of rockets to put satellites into orbit in recent years showed that the country had cleared some key technological hurdles. After the Norths satellite launch in February, South Korean defense officials said the Unha rocket used in the launch, if successfully reconfigured as a missile, could fly more than 7, 400 miles with a warhead of 1, 100 to 1, 300 pounds far enough to reach most of the United States. North Korea has deployed Rodong ballistic missiles that can reach most of South Korea and Japan, but it has had a spotty record in the Musudan, its ballistic missile with a range long enough to reach American military bases in the Pacific, including those on Guam. The North has also claimed a series of successes in testing various ICBM technologies, although its claims cannot be verified and are often disputed by officials and analysts in the region. It has said it could now make nuclear warheads small enough to fit onto a ballistic missile. It also claimed success in testing the technology that allows a missile to return to the Earths atmosphere without breaking up. In April, North Korea reported the successful ground test of an engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile. At the time, Mr. Kim said the North can tip intercontinental ballistic rockets with more powerful nuclear warheads and keep any cesspool of evils in the Earth, including the U. S. mainland, within our striking range.  On Sept. 9, the North conducted its fifth, and most powerful, nuclear test. Mr. Kim later attended another ground test of a new rocket engine, exhorting his government to prepare for another rocket launch as soon as possible. In November, the United Nations Security Council imposed new sanctions against the North."
Calling on Angels While Enduring the Trials of Job - The New York Times,New York Times,Andy Newman,12/31/2016,2016,12,,"Angels are everywhere in the Muiz familys apartment in the Bronx: paintings of angels on the wall, ceramic angels flanking the ancient VCR, angels strumming lyres or blowing little golden trumpets on the bathroom shelves. As JosÃ© and Zoraida Muiz and their children have struggled to deal with a series of trials and setbacks, including cancer, debilitating epilepsy, deep depression and near eviction, it has sometimes seemed as if angels and love were the only forces holding things together. Zoraidas early life in Puerto Rico was like something from a tropical Dickens novel. She and her siblings and mother built a house by hand after a hurricane ravaged their home and the childrens father withdrew support. Then Zoraidas grandfather the father of her absent father destroyed the house in a rage. She was barely a teenager when she met JosÃ©, a Vietnam War veteran. With permission from her uncle, a judge, they were married. She was 14. He was 29. They moved to New York in 1983 and started a new life. He built boilers. She worked in construction, using skills she learned as a child, and in a clothing store. But in 1987, Mr. Muiz began having violent seizures eight or 10 a day. They did not respond to medication. He could no longer work. She stopped working to take care of him. Still determined to live something like a normal life, they started a family. Their first child, JosÃ© Jr. had a heart defect. By the time he was 2 he had had six operations. Thats where the angels came in the first one was a painting, a gift from a cousin. When they operated on my son, they told me he was an angel, because he was supposed to die, Ms. Muiz, 50, said. From there I figured that angels are taking care of me and protecting me and my family.  All the angels are gifts from friends and relatives, or picked up off the street, just like all the furniture in the Muizes overstuffed apartment in a complex on Westchester Avenue in the Bronx, much of it restored by Ms. Muiz. So many people throw away things, so I dont have to buy, she said. A second son, Jesus, became epileptic at 3. A girl, Maria, completed the family. In 2007, Mr. Muiz had what felt like a horrible, stubborn toothache. It turned out to be cancer of the lower jaw. Ms. Muiz stayed in the room with her husband while he received radiation treatment. Im willing to take anything with him, she said. I never left him alone, and I never will.  Radiation did not work. To save Mr. Muizs life, surgeons removed his tongue and his lower jaw and cut a hole through his esophagus. Disfigured, depressed and unable to speak, he can consume nothing thicker than milk and needs care. This is the household where the Muiz children grew up. Weve been through every craziness, said JosÃ© Jr. 24, who has suffered depression so severe that he dropped out of college and confined himself to the apartment, every up and down.  For years at a time, the family held on, seemingly by a thread. Over the summer, the younger son, Jesus, 22, got a job at a Zaros Bakery in Manhattans financial district. Because the familys rent is tied to income, the rent tripled in August, to about $770 a month from $245. But Jesus had school bills to pay, and the family paid some of the funeral expenses for JosÃ© Sr. s mother, who died over the summer, and things began to unravel. They fell behind on the rent and utilities. Food was often scarce. The family regularly skipped meals. It was around this time that Ms. Muiz got in touch with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Timess Neediest Cases Fund. It covered their back rent, got them warm coats and blankets and helped them apply for food stamps for the first time. And with $600 from the Neediest Cases Fund, the family paid its electric bill. Things are looking up in some ways. Jesus is returning to college, where he is on a track and wants to be a paramedic. Maria graduated in December from a nursing program. Thinking of her father and his illness, she wants to be an oncologist. JosÃ© Jr. was just accepted to the New York Film Academys photography program. But JosÃ© Sr. continues to battle cancer. Zoraida is severely depressed. What keeps her going? she was asked. She gestured toward her family, sitting beside her beneath the painted angels. They give me my strength, even if I have times I collapse, she said. JosÃ© Jr. agreed. I use my parents and siblings as my motivation, he said. Were all there for each other, Ms. Muiz said."
Weak Federal Powers Could Limit Trumpâ€™s Climate-Policy Rollback - The New York Times,New York Times,Justin Gillis,1/3/2017,2017,1,,"With Donald J. Trump about to take control of the White House, it would seem a dark time for the renewable energy industry. After all, Mr. Trump has mocked the science of global warming as a Chinese hoax, threatened to kill a global deal on climate change and promised to restore the coal industry to its former glory. So consider what happened in the middle of December, after investors had had a month to absorb the implications of Mr. Trumps victory. The federal government opened bidding on a tract of the ocean floor off New York State as a potential site for a huge wind farm. Up, up and away soared the offers interest from the bidders was so fevered that the auction went through 33 rounds and spilled over to a second day. In the end, the winning bidder offered the federal Treasury $42 million, more than twice what the government got in August for oil leases oil leases in the Gulf of Mexico. Who won the bid? None other than Statoil, the Norwegian oil company, which is in the midst of a major campaign to turn itself into a big player in renewable energy. We do not know for sure that the New York wind farm will get built, but we do know this: The energy transition is real, and Mr. Trump is not going to stop it. On a global scale, more than half the investment in new electricity generation is going into renewable energy. That is more than $300 billion a year, a sign of how powerful the momentum has become. Wind power is booming in the United States, with the industry adding manufacturing jobs in the reddest states. When Mr. Trumps appointees examine the facts, they will learn that technician is projected to be the occupation in America over the next decade. The election of Mr. Trump left climate activists and environmental groups in despair. They had pinned their hopes on a Hillary Clinton victory and a continuation of President Obamas strong push to tackle global warming. Now, of course, everything is in flux. In the worst case, with a sufficiently pliant Congress, Mr. Trump could roll back a decade of progress on climate change. Barring some miraculous conversion on Mr. Trumps part, his election cannot be interpreted as anything but bad news for the climate agenda. Yet despair might be an overreaction. For starters, when Mr. Trump gets to the White House, he will find that the federal government actually has relatively little control over American energy policy, and particularly over electricity generation. The coal industry has been ravaged in part by cheap natural gas, which is abundant because of technological changes in the way it is produced, and there is no lever in the Oval Office that Mr. Trump can pull to reverse that. The intrinsically weak federal role was a source of frustration for Mr. Obama and his aides, but now it will work to the benefit of environmental advocates. They have already persuaded more than half the states to adopt mandates on renewable energy. Efforts to roll those back have largely failed, with the latest development coming only last week, when Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, vetoed a rollback bill. The federal government does offer important subsidies for renewable energy, and they will surely become a target in the new Congress. But those subsidies are already scheduled to fall drastically over five years, in a deal cut a year ago that gave the oil industry some favors and that passed Congress with many Republican votes. If Mr. Trump pushes for an early end to the subsidies, he will find that renewable energy has friends in the Republican Party. Topping that list is Charles E. Grassley, the senior senator from Iowa. That state in presidential politics, let us remember will soon be getting 40 percent of its electricity from wind power. Senator Grassley has been and continues to be an extraordinary leader and champion for the wind industry, said Tom Kiernan, the head of the American Wind Energy Association, a trade group. When I spoke with him last week, Mr. Kiernan did not sound like a man gnashing his teeth about the impending Trump era. By his groups calculations, $80 billion of wind industry investment is in the pipeline for the United States over the next few years. We are creating jobs throughout America, jobs, and we think Trump will want that to continue, he said. If Mr. Trump really wanted to roll back the clock, he could try to get Congress to override all the state mandates, a gross violation of the supposed conservative commitment to federalism. But it would be a titanic fight, some Republican senators would defect on principle, and Mr. Trump would almost certainly lose. So if the damage Mr. Trump can do domestically is limited by circumstance, what about the international effort against global warming? That is the prospect that has David G. Victor most worried. Dr. Victor, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, is one of the closest observers of global climate politics. While the nations of the world agreed a year ago to a landmark deal to tackle global warming, that consensus is fragile, he pointed out. The Paris Agreement is really an outline more promise than reality. Mr. Trump has vowed to withdraw. Right now, other countries are saying they will go forward even if he does so, but it is not hard to imagine the thing unraveling. As part of the negotiations, the Obama administration promised billions of dollars from American taxpayers to help poor countries adjust to the devastation of global warming. Thats a big part of the glue that held the Paris deal together, Dr. Victor pointed out. Mr. Trump is considered likely to abandon that pledge. Perhaps the biggest threat to the climate agenda posed by the incoming administration is not anything that Mr. Trump might do, but rather what he will not do. While the energy transition is real, it is still in its earliest stages. Iowa may soon get 40 percent of its power from wind, but for the United States as a whole, the figure is closer to 5 percent. The transition is simply not happening fast enough. The pledges countries made in Paris, even if kept, are not ambitious enough. To meet the climate goals embodied in the Paris Agreement, the world needed an American president who would have pushed hard to accelerate the energy transition. You can debate whether Mrs. Clinton would have been that president, but it is certainly clear that Mr. Trump will not be. So as Washington goes into reverse gear on climate policy, seas will keep rising and heat waves will get worse. Later this month, global monitoring agencies are expected to report that 2016 was the hottest year in the historical record, beating out 2015, which beat out 2014. If nothing else, the next four years may be a fascinating test of just how far politics can become divorced from physical reality."
"Mar-a-Lago, the Future Winter White House and Home of the Calmer Trump - The New York Times",New York Times,Maggie Haberman,1/2/2017,2017,1,,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. When Donald J. Trump rang in the new year this weekend, he did it in opulence, joined by the actor Sylvester Stallone, the gossip page fixture Fabio and a crowd of wealthy developers reveling under the swaying palm trees at Mr. Trumps resort in Palm Beach. President George W. Bush had his ranch in Crawford, Tex. His father had a compound in Kennebunkport, Me. President Obama has taken frequent vacations in Hawaii, staying at a private home. But Mr. Trumps private club in Florida, where he has spent the past two weeks away from his home in New York City, is likely to eclipse them all as the 45th presidents winter White House. And that was always the intention of Marjorie Meriweather Post, the cereal heiress and the propertys original owner, who left to the federal government when she died in 1973, hoping it would serve as a home for presidents. But the government had no interest in her plan, and Mr. Trump later bought the property for less than $10 million, turning it into a club where membership costs six figures. Mr. Trumps arrival was greeted with sneers by the Palm Beach elite, and he opened up s membership to Jews and who had been excluded from other establishments. He was also the first club owner on the island to admit an openly gay couple. Since Mr. Trumps victory in November, has been stuffed with guests attracted by an amenity unique to this club: the chance to rub shoulders with the next president. Its like going to Disneyland and knowing Mickey Mouse will be there all day long, said Jeff Greene, a developer and unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the Senate from Florida in 2010, who is a member and was a Hillary Clinton supporter. Instead of hosting major corporate executives and potential cabinet secretaries for interviews inside a boxy transition office at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Trump has been seated at an ornately designed couch, upholstered in pale fabric laced with gold, beneath a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, a scene resembling a mansion in Sunset Boulevard or Citizen Kane, two of Mr. Trumps favorite movies. At night, the couches are moved out and tables are added to accommodate the evening cocktail crowd, among whom Mr. Trump moves from one table to the next, the most powerful greeter in the world. At the annual New Years Eve party on Saturday night, a white menu included Mr. Trumps wedge salad, a wild mushroom and Swiss chard ravioli and a breakfast buffet.  Those in attendance drifted in under a striped awning, the men dressed in tuxedos, the women in ball gowns, many with their hair swept high. Guests stepped onto a red carpet as they entered the club and wandered over to a poolside cocktail party. Mr. Trump later delivered remarks, according to a guest, who said he thanked his family and the club members for their support over the years. Howie Carr, a conservative radio host who was supportive of Mr. Trump, roamed the crowd, with Mr. Carr posting on Twitter that his daughter asked Mr. Trump if she could be an intern in the White House. Mr. Trumps two adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr. posed for photographs. Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski from MSNBCs Morning Joe were also there. Like most aspects of Mr. Trumps business interests, the party generated controversy as tickets to it were made available to club members and guests for a little more than $500. Mr. Trumps aides rejected the questions. Mr. Trump returned to New York on Sunday night. But the club will remain an escape for him. His contentious Twitter posts belie his relative calm when he is at compared with when he is isolated inside Trump Tower. Mr. Trumps combative public persona often on display during his campaign mostly dissolves behind the walls of his castle. is an environment he can control, said the historian Douglas Brinkley, who last week attended a lunch with a longtime club member, Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media. I watched him hold court he was so comfortable in his own skin, and so relaxed.  Mr. Ruddy has hosted Mr. Carr and Laura Ingraham, another conservative radio host who supported Mr. Trump, at the club and has introduced Mr. Trump to a range of news media figures, politicians and donors. He described the as seeking the Donald Trump: totally at ease, very positive, very gregarious.  Mr. Trump appears to feed off contact with the people at the club. Over the Thanksgiving holiday, he queried dinner guests about whether he should appoint Rudolph W. Giuliani or Mitt Romney as his secretary of state (he ended up picking neither). During this trip, he has heaped praise on his ultimate choice for the job, Rex W. Tillerson, the head of Exxon Mobil. (Mr. Trump has called him Mr. Exxon. ) He talks about the work he has done to find a solution for the problems at the Department of Veteran Affairs, which included a recent meeting with a number of executives at . Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that he intended to make Brian Burns, the businessman son of a confidante of Joseph P. Kennedy, the ambassador to Ireland. Isaac Perlmutter, the reclusive head of Marvel Entertainment, is a member who helped Mr. Trump put that meeting together. Mr. Trump has also held with Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots and a club member, and hosted prominent figures like Carlos Slim, the billionaire who is Mexicos richest man. Mr. Trump his wife, Melania and their son, Barron, inhabit a residential area of the club. His adult children and their families usually stay in nearby cabanas on the property. Mr. Trump frequently dines on the patio, a central point of action, where at night a singer plays with a small band, sometimes belting out requests from Mr. Trump and other guests. (My Way, a song popularized by Frank Sinatra, was one recent choice.) A violinist sometimes moves among tables, plucking tunes like the theme from Fiddler on the Roof.  Mr. Trump has given the cadre of White House reporters who now cover him some access to the club, but grudgingly so he once again eluded the reporters covering him on Saturday, slipping away without any warning to play golf at another of his clubs nearby in Jupiter. And outside the confines of old grievances flare up. On the golf course, Mr. Trump spotted Harry Hurt, a biographer who wrote critically of Mr. Trump years ago, preparing to play a round with David H. Koch, a billionaire conservative donor. Mr. Trump ordered club officials to remove Mr. Hurt from the property, according to a Facebook post by Mr. Hurt. Over the years, Mr. Trump has also been perpetually at loggerheads with Palm Beach officials. He has filed lawsuits attempting to keep noisy planes from flying over and there have been disputes over the height of his oversize flagpole on the grounds. With its owners coming new job, the club has had some changes. Guests now go through an elaborate security screen to gain access to the main entrance. Secret Service agents are now sprinkled throughout the property, at night blending into the shrubbery along the grounds. Robin Bernstein, a club member for nearly 25 years, said that some club members might express frustration, but that most thought it was important that we keep Donald and his family safe.  Attendees seem to see a benefit so far in having the around, and expect it will continue. The loser in this game is Camp David, said Mr. Brinkley, referring to the longtime presidential retreat in Maryland. Once youre at and its so opulent and the idea of suddenly inserting yourself into Camp Davids Maryland mountains environment seems unlikely. "
Turning Your Vacation Photos Into Works of Art - The New York Times,New York Times,Stephanie Rosenbloom,4/14/2017,2017,4,,"Its the season for family travel and photos and perhaps enlarging some of those images of snowy landscapes or tropical getaways to decorate your home. There are, of course, the usual print services and methods. You can choose a glossy or matte finish, print a photo on canvas, or make it into a poster with a few clicks online at photo sites like Snapfish and Shutterfly, professional photo shops like Adorama and Mpix, or drugstores and chains like Walgreens and Costco. But the web is also home to many printing services, as well as uncommon surfaces on which to enlarge photos for display, be it burlap, wood boards, acrylic or fabric. Why not try some fresh sites and methods? I recently sent some quality iPhone vacation photos to a handful of companies that Id never used before and had them enlarged to various sizes and printed on different surfaces. Ive also offered some guidance about bulk digitizing those boxes of old travel photos sitting in your closet or basement so that you can begin the New Year if not with a vacation, then with a home. Of all the ways to turn photos into wall art, I was most interested in trying engineer prints, named for the large, lightweight prints used by architects. For less than the cost of a couple of movie tickets, you can make huge enlargements. Mind you, its a particular aesthetic, one thats most likely to appeal to people who are after an industrial, shabby chic or bohemian look. The paper is thin and the lines of the images are softer than a fine art print. And engineer prints need not be formally framed. People stick them to their walls with washi tape, a crafting tape that comes in innumerable colors and prints or they hang the prints using wood poster rails or skeleton clips. For a while, engineer prints from photos were primarily available in black and white, but now you can find them in color, too. One of the easiest ways to order them online is through Parabo Press, which is run by Photojojo, an online photography gear shop, and Zoomin, a photo printing service in Asia. As with all printing sites, you upload your image, zoom in closer if you like, and then click to buy. The sites engineer prints are 4 feet by 3 feet, and cost $20 in black and white, and $25 in color. I sent out two different photos to be made in black and white, and they came out, to my surprise, beautifully. I was impressed that they were able to be enlarged to such a degree and not look blurry. And the paper (while so thin I was worried about accidentally tearing it) lends it an artful, careless look rather than the expected framed print over the couch. Parabo Press is a breeze to use: Its clean and easy to read, your options are straightforward, and there are no annoying upsells. The site also offers prints on metal, glass, newsprint and Zines (handmade magazines) calendars photo books and prints from its Risograph machine, which uses ink and is described by Parabo as having a cult following since its invention in 1980s Japan.  A fabric print not soft like a bedsheet, more like a place mat made of matte woven fabric is another departure from a traditional photo enlargement. Order one from a site such as SnapBox and instead of framing it, you can peel and stick it on your wall. The sites fabric posters adhere to (and can be peeled off) smooth surfaces such as untextured walls, glass, ceilings, tile and finished wood surfaces (avoid surfaces like stucco, concrete blocks, brick, unfinished wood, canvas or freshly painted walls). SnapBox offers fabric posters in more than a dozen sizes from 4x4 to 36x54, from less than $2 to about $80. I ordered a 24x36 fabric poster for $34. 99, a discounted price thanks to a holiday coupon not cheap (you can buy fine art prints on other sites for less) but youre printing on special material. Regardless of the cost, I expected the finished product to look like the sort of cheap thing one might see in a dorm room (it sticks to walls, after all) but I was pleasantly surprised. The fabric was durable and the details in the photo crevasses in a glacier onlookers on a bridge were nicely defined. SnapBox is a site with clear instructions and pricing. In addition to fabric posters, it also offers fine art prints, photo books and prints on canvas and pillows. While many places can print photos on hard surfaces such as metal and acrylic, printing on wood boards is less common. The grain shows through your photos, which, thematically speaking, seems to make sense for certain subjects, like nature photos taken at, say, the beach or in a park. But what would something more modern, like a skyscraper or a tower, look like on wood? I decided to give it a try and put an image of Tokyo Tower on an 8x12 board ($65). I sent the photo to PhotoBarn, a family business that makes its products by hand in a  in Tennessee. The result was a lovely departure from framed prints and from canvas, which can sometimes make striking photos look like amateur paintings. The wood was smooth and thick, and the image was crisp with a slight sheen a perfect complement to the steel of Tokyo tower and the silver and glass of surrounding skyscrapers. For the most part the site is intuitive, though a few too many holiday sale buttons on the home page made for a disorienting start. PhotoBarn will also print your photos on canvas, burlap, and other wood products, like ornaments. I noticed a number of complaints about PhotoBarn on Yelp and the Better Business Bureau website regarding shipping speeds and customer service. I didnt have a problem, but if time is of the essence, you may want to check with the company before placing an order. Once youve turned the best of your travel photos into art, its time to store the rest. If boxes of prints are taking up closet (and psychic) space, there are plenty of sites online that will scan your old photos (as well as negatives, slides and videos) so you can store them digitally. But there are several things to keep in mind. In general, these sites are a pain to navigate. Theyre cluttered with too much text and fine print, and they offer so many options Do you want your photos scanned in order? Do you want both sides of the photo scanned? that if you dont have a goal in mind before you go in, you can quickly be overwhelmed. Decide ahead of time what exactly you want to scan, how many photos you have and how you might use whatever you scan. Also, note that some of these companies by default send DVDs or CDs of your digital files. Not everyone has a CD or DVD player. If you want a thumb drive instead, be sure to select that option (if its offered) or call the company and see if it will provide one. Be aware, too, that its not unusual for these companies to have long lead times. A number of them digitize your photos in other countries, so it can take weeks to get your images back. For affordable bulk scans, ScanMyPhotos. com is an old standby (you can read David Pogues review on nytimes. com). The company will scan about 1, 800 photos at 300 dpi for $145 at its headquarters in Irvine, Calif. the cost of sending the photo box to you, as well as the shipping of the box to ScanMyPhotos and back to you again is included in the price. Thats one of the least costly and most uncomplicated deals around. Other companies charge for shipping photo boxes. I asked a photo editor at The Times if 300 dpi is sufficient for scanning and she said that to print photos at larger sizes, a higher dpi is preferable. ScanMyPhotos has such an option: a prepaid box for $259 for the same number of scans at 600 dpi instead of 300 dpi. A thumb drive is an additional $15. 95 a box. To find the best place to scan photos and film, the Wirecutter, a consumer review site owned by The New York Times, researched 37 different scanning services and tested the top 12 contenders. Memories Renewed took the number one spot. The company, based in Minneapolis, Minn. offered the best combination of price, quality, and turnaround time of any service we tested, Wirecutter said. I was planning to try the service however, according to the Memories Renewed site, demand is so high at the moment that the lead time for most projects is more than two months. Scanning photos of any size up to 8. 5x11 is 60 cents a photo a thumb drive is $10 for 8 GB or $15 for 16 GB. Lets say you dont want to ship your irreplaceable photos in the mail. Or maybe youd rather that strangers not see your photos and home videos. You could buy a scanner and scan your photos yourself, perhaps doing a batch for half an hour each day. Personally, I dont want machines around my home collecting dust (and fast becoming outdated). So I decided to try the new PhotoScan app by Google Photos. Its free and enables users to scan prints with a smartphone. First things first: These are not scans. If you have prized photos in need of restoration, then go with a professional. However if, like me, you have a bunch of travel photos landscapes, food, monuments that youre keeping simply because you want to remember where you were when, you may want to consider trying the app instead of giving up some privacy and spending upward of $150. By and large, PhotoScan is simple and quick, with almost no learning curve. If you try it, just make sure to hold your phone level when asked to move it over the image. Remember these words: Dont tilt your phone! Most of the scans I made looked as good as the prints in terms of color and clarity. That said, this is unlikely to be your solution if you want prints or have thousands of photos to scan. Once you get the hang of PhotoScan, using it becomes a repetitive, vaguely activity. That is, unless the app crashes, which it did several times. But I was still glad for it. Even when it crashed, it took only the tap of a finger to begin again. And you cant beat the price."
"As Second Avenue Subway Opens, a Train Delay Ends in (Happy) Tears - The New York Times",New York Times,Emma G. Fitzsimmons,1/2/2017,2017,1,,"Finally. The Second Avenue subway opened in New York City on Sunday, with thousands of riders flooding into its polished stations to witness a piece of history nearly a century in the making. They descended beneath the streets of the Upper East Side of Manhattan to board Q trains bound for Coney Island in Brooklyn. They cheered. Their eyes filled with tears. They snapped selfies in front of colorful mosaics lining the walls of the stations. It was the first day of 2017, and it felt like a new day for a city that for so long struggled to build this sorely needed subway line. In a rare display of unbridled optimism from hardened New Yorkers, they arrived with huge grins and wide eyes, taking in the bells and whistles at three new stations. I was very choked up, Betsy Morris, 70, said as she rode the first train to leave the 96th Street station, at noon. How do you explain something that you never thought would happen? Its going to change the way everybody lives as far as commuting goes.  It was a major moment for New Yorks sprawling transit system after decades of failed efforts to bring the line to one of the few corners of Manhattan the subway did not reach. The opening of the first segment of the line an extension of the Q train to 96th Street promises to lighten the crush of passengers on the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 trains along Lexington Avenue, the nations most overcrowded subway line, which had been the only line on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. When the stations opened shortly before noon, they were quickly filled with giddy riders both young and old, and strollers, suitcases and dogs all familiar sights across the system. But for all the excitement, the line, with just three new stops, is much more modest than the ambitious route running the length of Manhattan that was once envisioned. It serves a relatively affluent and not very diverse part of the city, which has more than eight and a half million people and many and minority residents who live far from a subway line. With the subway reaching its highest ridership levels since 1948, much of the aging system is plagued by crowding and delays, even as subway and bus fares are expected to rise again in March. Still, there was reason to cheer. The opening of a new subway line is a rare occasion in the United States and comes at a time of mounting concern about the deteriorating state of the nations infrastructure, from its roadways and bridges to its public transit systems. Few new subway stations have opened in recent years, even as expansive subway networks have sprouted in Asia, and most American cities never built any in the first place. The major subways in the Northeast in New York, Washington and Boston are grappling with old equipment and funding shortfalls, with Washington experiencing a near meltdown over safety problems. With mounting bills for basic maintenance, these subways have largely failed to grow. So the arrival of the Second Avenue subway, which was first proposed in the 1920s, was a notable achievement for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the citys vast network of subways, buses and commuter railroads. The first phase of the project took nearly a decade to build and cost about $4. 4 billion. With the opening, the map of the citys loved and loathed subway adds three new stations, bringing the total to 472 the most of any subway in the world. A station that opened at Hudson Yards on Manhattans Far West Side in 2015 was the citys first new station in a . On Sunday, New Yorkers were mesmerized by the artwork adorning the walls. At the 72nd Street stop, Sumana Harihareswara stopped to gaze at a mosaic of a woman of South Asian descent dressed in a burgundy sari, looking at her cellphone. Ms. Harihareswara was overcome with emotion. I dont think Ive ever come across subway art before that makes me feel so seen, she said through tears. This woman could be my aunt she could be my cousin.  She and a stranger exchanged a knowing glance. Representation matters, they agreed. Ms. Harihareswara, a longtime transit enthusiast from Astoria, Queens, said she was struck by the diversity portrayed in the mosaics, including a mural of a gay couple holding hands. There is no feeling quite like seeing yourself cemented into the infrastructure of New York, Ms. Harihareswara said. After decades of aborted efforts to build the Second Avenue line, and at least three groundbreakings in the 1970s, construction on the current segment began in 2007. The line was originally projected to open in 2013, but subway officials pushed the deadline to the end of 2016 many years ago. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who effectively controls the authority, pressed officials to meet the December 2016 deadline even as concerns grew that the subway would not be ready in time. Still, the agency made the deadline just barely with a lavish inaugural ride on New Years Eve for a collection of dignitaries that culminated in a midnight toast. Although many New Yorkers believe the city runs the subways, it is actually the governor who appoints the authoritys chairman and holds considerable sway over the agency. Mr. Cuomo has capitalized on the Second Avenue opening to raise his national profile, overshadowing his frequent nemesis Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who attended the inaugural ride on Saturday but was not given a speaking slot. Despite general good will over the opening, some transit advocates expressed concerns over the high cost of the project and questioned whether officials would move aggressively to extend the line to 125th Street in East Harlem as planned. On Sunday morning, Mr. Cuomo arrived at the 96th Street station with the authoritys chairman, Thomas F. Prendergast, to join the first trip for regular riders, who cheered as the train pulled out of the station. Then Mr. Cuomos voice came over the loudspeaker. Rest assured: Im not driving the train, he joked. The first day of service was smooth, although there were a few hiccups. Around 3 p. m. there were delays on the Q line because of a train with mechanical problems at the City Hall station. About an hour earlier, the elevator at the new 86th Street stop had begun to malfunction, stranding passengers above and below ground. Strollers were wheeled onto steep escalators. Parents became upset. Jill Tallmer, 62, and her mother, Margot Tallmer, 91, contemplated visiting another day. Weve been waiting for 10 years, or more, to ride, the younger Ms. Tallmer said while standing with her mother, a lifelong New Yorker who is in a wheelchair. Hopefully, its almost ready for us.  It was not, and they left after a few minutes. At the 72nd Street station, George Braith, a jazz saxophonist, was being mobbed by an eager pack of veritable paparazzi. The reason for his newfound celebrity: His likeness is featured in a mosaic there. Would you look at that guy? Mr. Braith, 77, said. Pretty handsome fellow if you ask me.  He is one of several local celebrities portrayed in the artwork, including chef Daniel Boulud. In Mr. Braiths mosaic, he is clad in a slick red blazer and carrying his signature Braithophone, alto and soprano saxophones melded into one. Taking the instrument from his suitcase, he obliged the crowd with a brief tune. Are you famous? a asked, seeing the hubbub. In the jazz world, Mr. Braith replied. The man shook his head and said, Well, youre immortalized as far as Im concerned.  Another celebrant, Ian Ma, 15, lives in Sheepshead Bay, a waterfront neighborhood in southern Brooklyn that is nowhere near the new subway line. But he has been enchanted by trains since he started rolling toy models on the floor as a child, he said, and he cajoled his parents into giving him a ride. I feel like Ive been waiting for this train my whole life, he said, seemingly speaking for many others."
Dylann Roof Himself Rejects Best Defense Against Execution - The New York Times,New York Times,Kevin Sack and Alan Blinder,1/2/2017,2017,1,," pages into the journal found in Dylann S. Roofs car after the assertions of black inferiority, the lamentations over white powerlessness, the longing for a race war comes an incongruous declaration. I want state that I am morally opposed to psychology, wrote the young white supremacist who would murder nine black worshipers at Emanuel A. M. E. Church in Charleston, S. C. in June 2015. It is a Jewish invention, and does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they dont.  Mr. Roof, who plans to represent himself when the penalty phase of his federal capital trial begins on Tuesday, apparently is devoted enough to that proposition (or delusion, as some maintain) to stake his life on it. Although a defense based on his psychological capacity might be his best opportunity to avoid execution, he seems steadfastly committed to preventing any public examination of his mental state or background. I will not be calling mental health experts or presenting mental health evidence, he wrote to Judge Richard M. Gergel of Federal District Court on Dec. 16, a day after a jury took only two hours to find him guilty of 33 counts, including hate crimes resulting in death, obstruction of religion and firearms violations. At a hearing on Wednesday, Mr. Roof told the judge that he planned to make an opening statement but not call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf. The testimony presented by prosecutors during the guilt phase of Mr. Roofs trial detailed with gruesome precision how he had plotted and executed the massacre during a Wednesday night Bible study in the churchs fellowship hall. It was less satisfying in revealing why he had done it. With his choice to sideline his legal team and represent himself, the second phase when the same jury of nine whites and three blacks will decide whether to sentence him to death or to life in prison may prove little different. Death penalty experts said it was exceedingly rare for capital defendants to represent themselves after allowing lawyers to handle the initial part of a case. Mr. Roof, who also faces a death penalty trial in state court, has not publicly explained his reasoning. But legal filings strongly suggest a split with his defenders about whether to argue that his rampage resulted from mental illness. Mr. Roofs lead lawyer, David I. Bruck, tried repeatedly to plant that notion during the guilt phase, knowing it might be his only chance. Because evidence of mitigating factors is supposed to be reserved for the penalty phase, Judge Gergel allowed him little leeway. In his closing argument, while acknowledging Mr. Roofs guilt, Mr. Bruck managed to tell the jury that Mr. Roof subscribed to the mad idea that he can make things better by massacring the most virtuous, kind and gentle people he could ever have found.  Mr. Bruck seeded his speech with words like abnormal, irrationality, senselessness, delusional, obsession and perseveration, a psychiatric term referring to the uncontrollable repetition of a particular response. Mr. Bruck, one of the countrys most experienced death penalty litigators, portrayed his client as a loner whose most meaningful relationship seemed to be with his cat who staged hundreds of photographs of himself with no sign of friends whose racial hatred was ignited by internet searches and not personal experience who could not pinpoint during his confession to the F. B. I. how many he had killed, how long he had spent at the church or even what month it was who had no escape plan and left suicide notes to his parents. There was something in him that made him feel that he had to do it, Mr. Bruck said, and that is as much as he knows.  After receiving the results of a psychiatric examination in November, Judge Gergel found Mr. Roof competent to stand trial meaning that he was capable of understanding the proceedings and assisting in his defense. At Mr. Brucks request, the judge scheduled a second competency hearing for Monday, but he signaled last week that he saw no reason to delay the penalty phase. The judge has repeatedly warned Mr. Roof against representing himself, including immediately after the verdicts, when he called it a bad decision and urged him to fully appreciate the implications.  The warnings have had no discernible effect on Mr. Roof, who has until Tuesday to reverse his decision to relegate his lawyers to standby counsel. That status allows Mr. Bruck and his team to offer guidance, but not to question witnesses or make objections. Prosecutors plan a procession of grief, perhaps calling dozens of members of victims families to testify about the impact of the killings. The prosecutors are also likely to the considerable evidence of Mr. Roofs premeditation and clearly articulated racial intent. Death penalty experts said the absence of mental health evidence to mitigate those aggravating factors could be decisive. If the jury views Roof as evil and having made a knowing, intelligent choice to kill these innocent, churchgoing people in order to foment racial hatred, they are much more likely to impose the death penalty than if they believe him to be a young and severely mentally ill person who acted under delusional racist beliefs, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a research group. It would take only one holdout on the jury, which consists of 10 women and two men, to spare Mr. Roof from lethal injection. Judge Gergel has ruled that the jurors can be told that prosecutors had rejected Mr. Roofs offer, through Mr. Bruck, to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. Many in Charleston were relieved by Mr. Roofs conviction in light of the mistrial that had been declared 10 days earlier in the state murder prosecution of Michael T. Slager, the white North Charleston policeman whose fatal shooting of a black motorist in 2015 was captured on video. Even those who oppose the death penalty on moral grounds, like the Rev. Joseph A. Darby, a presiding elder for the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, said it would seem bewildering for Mr. Roof to escape capital punishment. That could very well be the end of the death penalty in America, because if there was ever justification for killing anybody, this is the case, Mr. Darby said. There is no consensus among members of the victims families about Mr. Roofs fate. When the Justice Department elected in May to seek the death penalty, it acted against the wishes of many and of the two women he had spared. Five relatives offered Mr. Roof a measure of forgiveness at a remarkable bond hearing two days after the shootings. But by law, those who testify now are prohibited from telling the jury what penalty they think he should receive. Its going to be extremely emotional, powerful testimony, said John H. Blume, a death penalty expert who teaches at Cornell Law School, and that emotion could implicitly and misleadingly indicate to the jury that some of these people want the death penalty when its not the case.  If Mr. Roof is sentenced to death, it will be the first time a jury has done so in a prosecution involving the federal hate crimes law, according to experts on capital cases. That statute, which was broadened in 2009, does not carry a potential death sentence, but Mr. Roof was also convicted of other crimes that do. A death sentence most likely would give way to a yearslong series of appeals (in which Mr. Roof could not represent himself). Among the issues could be the composition of the jury, given that Mr. Roof acted rather passively as his own lawyer when it was selected the withholding of evidence on mental health and other mitigating factors and Mr. Roofs competence to stand trial and to represent himself. In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in Indiana v. Edwards that trial judges could insist on legal representation for defendants who are competent enough to stand trial but who suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves.  Mr. Bruck and his team have argued in court filings that Mr. Roof, a dropout, has no right to represent himself in a capital trial, and even less so at the penalty phase.  But in the 41 years since the Supreme Court recognized a Sixth Amendment right of for criminal defendants, in Faretta v. California, the court has never specifically narrowed that holding for death penalty trials, despite their complexity. Some death penalty opponents hope that Mr. Roofs defiance will prompt the appellate courts to adopt a more rigorous standard for capital defendants. Whether or not theyre legally insane, theres certainly something mentally wrong with them, said Peter D. Greenspun, a lawyer who was ousted by a defendant, John A. Muhammad, for part of a capital murder trial for the 2002 sniper attacks in the Washington area. He added, To have a person like that make this kind of decision, it really calls into question, from a philosophical point of view, whether that person is in a position to understand their civil liberties.  Mr. Muhammad, who ultimately reinstated Mr. Greenspun, was sentenced to death in 2003 and executed six years later. Its something that Roof will likely regret, Mr. Greenspun predicted of his choice to represent himself. At some point down the road, hes going to say, What did I do? And theres no going back. "
"Modiâ€™s Cash Ban Brings Pain, but Corruption-Weary India Grits Its Teeth - The New York Times",New York Times,Geeta Anand,1/2/2017,2017,1,,"MUMBAI, India It was a bold and risky gamble by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India that quickly seemed to backfire. The announcement of a ban on the largest currency bills circulating in India, which came into full effect at midnight Friday, the last day for depositing the old notes at banks, set off cash shortages that have hit the countrys most vulnerable people hard and prompted worries about the economy. But despite those concerns, as well as doubts about whether the currency ban will reduce corruption as it is designed to do, for the moment, at least, Mr. Modis bet appears to be paying off in the public arena. Even as the poorest Indians have struggled, many have continued to voice support for the prime ministers initiative to target the vast amounts of untaxed money, known as black money, flowing through the countrys economy, in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption. Mr. Modi, analysts say, has successfully tapped into deep frustration with the corruption that pervades almost every public interface with government. Even though the cash ban has produced enormous hardship for me and my family, I support what Mr. Modi is doing for our country, said Hem Raj Chechi, 39, a taxi driver in New Delhi, the capital, who said business had been down 50 percent since the ban was announced. Mr. Chechi has not been able to pay his childrens school fees or send money back to his village to support them for nearly two months. But, he said, We need to fight black money, even though it is hurting little people like me.  Mr. Modi came to power as a disruptive force pledging to overturn the status quo in New Delhi, bring jobs and fight corruption. Indians have repeatedly taken to the streets in recent years to demand an end to corruption, widely seen as being most detrimental to the poor and powerless. Declaring war on corruption, Mr. Modi announced on Nov. 8 that 500 and 1, 000 rupee bills, worth about $8 and $15, would be banned the next morning. With the currency ban, Mr. Modi has managed to convince many disaffected Indians that he is on their side. He has also used his powerful skills as a communicator to persuade people like Mr. Chechi that the pain stemming from the ban is for the good. That frustration with a political and business elite viewed by many as corrupt is what drove many Americans to vote for Donald J. Trump last year, said Eswar S. Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University who is a native of India. Trump made the case that only he could effect change by blowing up the system, Mr. Prasad said in an interview. Modi, in the same way, did have a persuasive narrative that small changes at the margins cant tackle problems like corruption. We needed big and painful changes, really disruptive ones.  Mr. Modi appeared on television on New Years Eve to tell Indians he understood their pain and urge them to bear with him in the aim of creating a better nation. He compared his cash ban to the freedom struggle led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, a battle of good versus evil. Today Mahatma Gandhi is not among us, but the path that was truth that he showed us is still most appropriate, Mr. Modi said, using the honorific for Gandhi. As we begin the centenary year of the Satyagraha, he said, referring to Gandhis nonviolent resistance movement, let us recall the Mahatma and resolve to follow his message of truth and goodness.  Mr. Modi was presiding over one of the major economies in the world when he announced the ban on the rupee notes, which made up 86 percent of the money in circulation. Its a little bit crazy, said Geng Xiao, a professor of finance and public policy at the University of Hong Kong. When I first read the news, I couldnt even figure out if it was true.  The government said that people depositing large amounts of old currency more than 250, 000 rupees, or about $3, 670, could be asked to prove that they had paid taxes on it. Some saw vast amounts of untaxed holdings suddenly rendered worthless. Whether Mr. Modis move will actually reduce corruption is a matter of debate. Some economists believe it could pave the way for other measures intended to discourage bribery or restructure the economy. But others say the currency ban is unlikely to result in a significant reduction in corruption, even as it has inconvenienced hundreds of millions of people who have struggled to get enough cash to meet their daily needs while the government tries to print enough new notes to replace the banned ones. And a country short of cash has been unable to spend it, which is likely to reduce economic growth in the short term, economists say. People living on the edge of poverty have been hit hard, their diets and livelihoods severely affected. Many in India see Mr. Modi, who has also had success persuading Parliament to clear the way for a unified tax to make it easier to ship and sell things across state lines, as living up to his promise to be a reformer of Indias ossified and bureaucratic economy. But in the process, he has placed the Indian economy and his political future at risk. Many economists believe that the Indian economy will take at least a hit because of a dire shortage of cash, and that the future impact is uncertain. If the effects are prolonged, the public support for Modi could wane. If this move damages the economy, hes in for a rough ride, said Harsh Pant, the head of strategic studies at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank. Mr. Xiao said that in a system in which the informal sector is substantial, the economy could be expected to experience a shock when so much cash is suddenly taken out. You need offsetting stimulus policies to keep the economy growing, he said. Mr. Modi was elected by an overwhelming majority in 2014, defeating the government, led by the Indian National Congress party, that had ruled for most of the countrys life, on the promise of bringing development and jobs and reducing corruption. In 2014, he had presented himself as the big disrupter, Mr. Pant said. He was the precursor to whats happening in the West.  Mr. Modi was then the chief minister of the state of Gujarat, where he had a reputation for tearing away the countrys red tape so businesses could set up shop and expand. But during his first two years after winning national election, Mr. Modi, whose party did not control the upper house of Parliament, struggled to achieve a significant economic overhaul. Mr. Modi changed the political narrative in 2016 as he successfully fought to get Parliament to clear the way for the simplified tax. He cast the opposition as people who dont want change, who dont want reform, Mr. Pant said, forcing them in August to support the changes. But the challenges facing Mr. Modi remain considerable. Seven weeks after the cash ban began to be put in place, the currency shortage remains acute, leading to a sharp drop in demand for services and earnings, many providers said. Nagender Tiwari, 42, a rickshaw driver in East Delhi, said he was earning only 60 percent of the 1, 000 rupees, or about $15, that he used to take home daily before the cash ban. As a result, his family, which includes two children in 11th grade, has reduced its consumption of fish and meat. They have been unable to pay the rent on their home, he said. He said he was skeptical about whether the ban was reducing corruption, noting that he continued to be stopped by traffic police officers who extorted bribes. So if bribery is not stopped, how can black money be stopped? he asked. Raj Kumar Bindal, 65, a paper trader in New Delhi, said sales that plummeted to nearly nothing in the days after the cash ban had returned to about half of what they were before. We cant shift to a cashless mode overnight, he said. Surjit Bhalla, a New economic adviser for the Observatory Group in New York, said he believed Mr. Modi was likely to enact several other major changes in the coming months, possibly including a move to a simplified personal income tax. India needs to reduce the incentives for taxpayers to cheat, Mr. Bhalla said. In the United States, for every $100 collected in income tax, an estimated $20 owed is not paid, he added. In India, for that same $100 in taxes paid, $200 more is owed, he said. Collectively, the cash ban and other anticorruption initiatives have the potential to transform India, Mr. Pant and others said. But doing so depends on Mr. Modis continuing to command the political narrative of the country, as he has so successfully done since instituting the cash ban. So far, he has taken control of the narrative and the people are with him, Mr. Pant said. He thinks he can continue to do it, but we really dont know. There are so many unknowns. "
Suicide Bombing in Baghdad Kills at Least 36 - The New York Times,New York Times,The Associated Press,1/3/2017,2017,1,,"BAGHDAD A suicide bomber detonated a pickup truck loaded with explosives on Monday in a busy Baghdad market, killing at least 36 people hours after President FranÃ§ois Hollande of France arrived in the Iraqi capital. The Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomb went off in a produce market that was packed with day laborers, a police officer said, adding that another 52 people were wounded. During a news conference with Mr. Hollande, Haider Iraqs prime minister, said the suicide bomber had pretended to be a man seeking to hire day laborers. Once the workers gathered around, he detonated the vehicle. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a website that is often used by the group. It was the third such attack in three days in or near Baghdad, underscoring the lingering threat posed by the extremist group despite a string of setbacks for it elsewhere in the country over the past year, including in and around the northern city of Mosul. The attack took place in Sadr City, a vast Shiite district in eastern Baghdad that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists since the 2003 invasion. Militiamen loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived. Bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit, vegetables and laborers shovels and axes. A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire. Asaad Hashim, 28, an owner of a nearby cellphone store, described how the laborers had pushed and shoved around the bombers vehicle, trying to get hired. Then a big boom came, sending them up into the air, said Mr. Hashim, who suffered shrapnel wounds to his right hand. He blamed the most ineffective security forces in the world for failing to prevent the attack. An angry crowd cursed the government, even after a representative of Mr. Sadr tried to calm them. Late last month, the Iraqi authorities started removing some of the security checkpoints in Baghdad in a bid to ease traffic for the capitals six million residents. We have no idea who will kill at any moment and whos supposed to protect us, said Ali Abbas, a father of four who was hurled over his vegetable stand by the blast. If the securities forces cant protect us, then allow us to do the job.  Several smaller bombings elsewhere in the city on Monday killed at least 20 civilians and wounded at least 70, according to medics and police officials. All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters. The United States State Department condemned the attacks. Separately, the American military announced on Monday the death of a coalition service member in Iraq in a incident, without providing further details. Mr. Hollande met with Mr. Abadi and President Fuad Masum, and later traveled to the northern Kurdish region to meet with French troops and local officials. He pledged to help displaced Iraqis return to Mosul, where Iraqi forces are waging a large offensive against the Islamic State. France is part of the coalition formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State after the extremist group seized large areas in Iraq and neighboring Syria. France has suffered multiple attacks claimed by the extremist group."
Fecal Pollution Taints Water at Melbourneâ€™s Beaches After Storm - The New York Times,New York Times,Brett Cole,1/3/2017,2017,1,,"SYDNEY, Australia The annual beach pilgrimage during the height of summer in Melbourne, Australias city, is threatened by an unsettling phenomenon: shores where the tides are tainted with excrement. The Environment Protection Authority in the state of Victoria said on Monday that heavy rains had caused fecal pollution to wash into Port Phillip from rivers, creeks and drains. It advised against swimming at 21 beaches because of poor water quality. Its poo in all its luxurious forms that is causing the problem, said Anthony Boxshall, the agencys manager of applied sciences, noting that the waste was coming from people, dogs, horses, cows, birds and other animals. Fecal pollution can cause serious health problems, including gastroenteritis. Mr. Boxshall said much of the waste had been washed down the Yarra River that runs through Melbourne into Port Phillip, affecting the citys bayside beaches the most. The agency, which takes regular water samples, rates beaches. A good rating means that the water is suitable for swimming. Fair means that rainfall has affected the water. Poor means people should avoid it. Residents said that the pollution had deterred them from indulging in a favorite summer ritual. When the temperature gets above 86 Fahrenheit, Melbournians typically pack the family in the car with food and drink and spend the day at the beach, said Sam Riley, who lives in the city. I was going to take my two young boys to the beach myself over the summer, but now Im concerned about whether the water is clean.  Mr. Boxshall said any improvement in the beaches water quality was uncertain as long as the rain continued. The agency says it usually takes between 24 and 48 hours for the waters to clear after the rain stops."
"N.F.L. Playoffs: Schedule, Matchups and Odds - The New York Times",New York Times,Benjamin Hoffman,1/3/2017,2017,1,,"When the Green Bay Packers lost to the Washington Redskins in Week 11, dropping to Aaron Rodgers vowed to run the table in a march to the playoffs. With a victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday night, the team fulfilled Rodgers promise. Much of the drama of the matchup between division rivals was eliminated earlier in the day when the Redskins lost to the Giants, thus guaranteeing both the Packers and Lions would be playoff teams, but the N. F. C. North bragging rights, and a home game in the first round of the playoffs, were sufficient motivation for Green Bay to push hard enough to secure the teams sixth consecutive win and the third consecutive loss for Detroit. Pundits had spent the week deciphering all of the wild scenarios that could play out for positioning among the remaining teams. But when all was said and done, ten of the teams that were in line for a playoff spot remained in the same seeding order. No. 6 Detroit Lions at No. 3 Seattle Seahawks Time: 8:15 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on NBC The Seahawks title hopes took a crushing blow when Earl Thomas was lost for the season with a broken leg. After the injury, the Seahawks went with the wins coming with major asterisks as they came against the Rams and 49ers. That collapse paled in comparison to the Lions, who lost their final three games, blowing what had been a large division lead against Green Bay. Line: Seahawks ( : 43) No. 5 Giants at No. 4 Green Bay Packers Time: 4:40 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on Fox Thanks to playing in the N. F. C. East, home of the Dallas Cowboys, the Giants managed to tie Atlanta for the record in the N. F. C. but got stuck with the No. 5 seed in the playoffs and a road game against a Packers squad that won its final six games. The good news for the Giants is that superstitious fans will note that the last two times they played the Packers on the road in the playoffs, they not only won the games but went on to win the Super Bowl both times. Line: Packers ( : 44. 5) Bye weeks: Dallas, Atlanta No. 5 Oakland Raiders at No. 4 Houston Texans Time: 4:35 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on ESPN Line: Texans ( : 37) The Texans were the least inspiring of the N. F. L. s division champions and that was complicated further when Tom Savage, whom the team had elevated to starting quarterback after the benching of Brock Osweiler, was forced to leave Week 17s loss to Tennessee with a concussion. As bad as that sounds, it may still be enough against a reeling Oakland squad that lost Derek Carr to a broken leg in Week 16, Matt McGloin to a shoulder injury in Week 17, and fell all the way from the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. to No. 5. It is unclear at this point if McGloin or rookie Connor Cook will start at quarterback against Houston. No. 6 Miami Dolphins at No. 3 Pittsburgh Steelers Time: 1:05 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on CBS The Dolphins were a contender when the teams quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, was lost in Week 14 with injured ligaments in his left knee. Thanks to backup quarterback Matt Moore, and Jay Ajayi, the teams running back, they won two of three games and secured a berth. But going up against a offense like Pittsburgh is a tough test for Miamis middling defense, even if Tannehills knee heals enough to allow him to return. Line: Steelers .5 ( : 47. 5) Bye weeks: New England, Kansas City With four teams vying for two N. F. C. playoff spots, all eyes were on the game on Sunday. A Redskins victory could have caused movement in the seedings, with the Lions and Packers playing a evening matchup. The Giants, who had already locked up the No. 5 seed and had nothing to gain, threw a wrench in the Redskins plans, eliminating their division rivals with a decisive victory. With the drama essentially taken out of the N. F. C. all of the playoff movement Sunday occurred in the A. F. C. where there was a at the top of the standings in the A. F. C. West. Just a week after losing Derek Carr, the teams quarterback and a legitimate candidate for most valuable player, to a broken leg, the Oakland Raiders were crushed by the Denver Broncos. That, combined with the Kansas City Chiefs victory over the San Diego Chargers vaulted the Chiefs from a spot all the way to the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. which comes with a bye in the playoffs. The loss for Oakland added to the misery of the Raiders, who have gone from Super Bowl contenders last week to a team that will play on the road in Houston next week potentially with a quarterback under center as Carrs backup, Matt McGloin, injured his shoulder in the loss to the Broncos. Beyond the switch to the Chiefs as the No. in the A. F. C. it was business as usual for the teams that will get bye weeks in the playoffs. The New England Patriots secured the No. 1 spot in the A. F. C. with a win over Miami, the Dallas Cowboys were already guaranteed the No. 1 spot in the N. F. C. before their loss to Philadelphia, and the Atlanta Falcons held onto the No. 2 seed in the N. F. C. with a win over New Orleans. The only remaining chance for a minor was for the Packers, who led their division by virtue of a tiebreaker, to lose to the Lions, which would have forced them to play on the road in the round of the playoffs. But the aspect of the de facto N. F. C. North championship went away when the Redskins lost to the Giants, which eliminated the Redskins from contention. While most of the races were straight forward, one of the crazier playoff scenarios that had been discussed before the week was the possibility that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could find themselves in the playoffs. They simply had to shoot the moon by beating the Carolina Panthers, having the Redskins tie the Giants, the Packers lose to the Lions, and should all of that happen they simply required wins by Indianapolis, Dallas, Tennessee and San Francisco to top the Packers in strength of schedule. Tampa Bay took care of their end by beating the Panthers early in the day, but they were eliminated officially when Dallas lost to Philadelphia."
Mariah Careyâ€™s Manager Blames Producers for New Yearâ€™s Eve Nightmare - The New York Times,New York Times,Patrick Healy,1/2/2017,2017,1,,"Mariah Carey suffered through a performance train wreck in Times Square on New Years Eve as malfunctions left her at a loss vocally during her hit song Emotions, struggling to reach notes and to sync the lyrics and music. The trouble continued when she gave up on another of her numbers, We Belong Together, while a recording of the song continued to play, a confirmation that she had been . But on Sunday, a dispute erupted between Ms. Careys representatives and producers of ABCs Dick Clarks New Years Rockin Eve With Ryan Seacrest, on which the singer was performing. Ms. Careys manager, Stella Bulochnikov, charged that the shows producers had been aware of technical problems but did not fix them and chose to continue showing Ms. Careys messy performance to get ratings.  I will never know the truth, but I do know that we told them three times that her mike pack was not working and it was a disastrous production, Ms. Bulochnikov told Us Weekly magazine on Sunday. Im certainly not calling the F. B. I. to investigate. It is what it is: New Years Eve in Times Square. Mariah did them a favor. She was the biggest star there, and they did not have their act together. Dick Clark Productions, which produced the show, issued a statement on Sunday night saying that Ms. Careys performance woes had nothing to do with the production, and that any suggestion that the company would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd.  In very rare instances, there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television, the statement said, adding that an initial investigation suggested that the production company had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Careys New Years Eve performance.  A veteran audio producer, Robert Goldstein of Maryland Sound International, a company that has worked on the Times Square event for years, also said in an email that there had been no malfunctions with the sound equipment he oversaw. Every monitor and device worked perfectly, Mr. Goldstein said. I cant comment beyond that and dont know what her nontechnical issue may have been.  A spokeswoman for Ms. Carey said on Sunday that the singer was not at fault for her performance. Unfortunately there was nothing she could do to continue with the performance given the circumstances, the spokeswoman, Nicole Perna, told The Associated Press. It was a rare meltdown on national television by one of the recording artists of all time. Ms. Carey, a pop phenomenon in the 1990s who won five Grammys out of 34 nominations over the years, was the final act on ABCs Dick Clarks New Years Rockin Eve With Ryan Seacrest.  She had just finished Auld Lang Syne when her star turn began to spiral out of control. We cant hear, she said in the opening seconds of Emotions after she sashayed down the stage before more than one million people who had gathered to watch the ball drop in Manhattan. Standing still with her left hand on her hip while music played, Ms. Carey told the audience that there had not been a proper sound check before her performance. Then she said, Well just sing, and noted proudly of her song, It went to No. 1.  But she could not manage the notes that followed, and she either forgot lyrics or did not want to deliver a subpar performance. Were missing some of these vocals, but it is what it is, she said. Let the audience sing.  ABC quickly cut to shots of the Times Square crowd as Ms. Carey tried to perform some of her choreography. She continued suggesting fixes from the stage, and at one point seemed to defend herself. Im trying to be a good sport here, she said. When the number ended, the crowd cheered her on. That was  she said, pausing for effect, amazing.  She seemed to recover at first with We Belong Together, but there appeared to be another malfunction, and Ms. Carey again stopped singing. But this time, the prerecorded number kept playing. It just dont get any better, she said, and then left the stage. The cause of the problem was not immediately clear. After the performance, Ms. Carey posted a mildly profane slang phrase on Twitter with an upset emoji, then wrote: Have a happy and healthy new year everybody! Heres to making more headlines in 2017.  An ABC spokesman said on Sunday that the network would not comment on the problems with Ms. Careys performance."
"Damaged by War, Syriaâ€™s Cultural Sites Rise Anew in France - The New York Times",New York Times,Marlise Simons,1/1/2017,2017,1,,"PARIS When the Islamic State was about to be driven out of the ancient city of Palmyra in March, Yves Ubelmann got a call from Syrias director of antiquities to come over in a hurry. An architect by training, Mr. Ubelmann, 36, had worked in Syria before the country was engulfed by war. But now there was special urgency for the kind of work his youthful team of architects, mathematicians and designers did from their cramped offices in Paris: producing digital copies of threatened historical sites. Palmyra, parts of it already destroyed by the Islamists who deemed these monuments idolatrous, was still rigged with explosives. So he and Houmam Saad, his Syrian colleague, spent four days flying a drone with a robot camera over the crumbled arches and temples. Drones with four or six rotors can hover really close and register structural details, every crack and hole, and we can take very precise measurements, said Mr. Ubelmann, who founded the company Iconem. This is the stuff architects and archaeologists need.  They need it in a new push for virtual preservation that scientists, archaeologists and others, like Mr. Ubelmann, are compiling on a large scale. The records could be used to create computer models that would show how monuments and endangered historical sites might one day be restored, repaired or reconstructed. Of special interest today are ancient sites in Syria, and also Iraq, that have suffered from war, looting and the Islamic State. Palmyra was very difficult, Mr. Ubelmann said. The terrorists were uploading videos with them blowing up monuments and smashing statues to manipulate public opinion, he said. We felt the best response was to magnify the pictures of these places and show their splendor and their importance to the culture. It became a war of images.  The latest front in that war is in the exhibition halls of the Grand Palais in Paris, where, through Jan. 9, many of the 40, 000 images he and his team took at Palmyra have become the basis for displays. Called Eternal Sites: From Bamiyan to Palmyra, the show aims to draw attention to the rising threats to global heritage. To underscore the exhibitions political importance, it was opened several weeks ago by President FranÃ§ois Hollande of France, who described it as an act of resistance against terror and intolerance. Showing the beauty of the Middle Eastern heritage, he said, is the best answer to the Islamist propaganda of hate, destruction and death.  Martinez, the director of the Louvre and the lead curator of the show, said the sites had been chosen because all are under threat from pillaging, neglect or destruction and are not accessible to the public.  He said it aimed to mobilize public opinion in the face of the devastation of unique heritage.  Besides images from Palmyra, the multimedia show projects enormous photographs and videos, immersing visitors in different eras, including the ancient Iraqi city of Khorsabad around 700 B. C. an mosque in Damascus and a medieval Christian citadel. Mr. Ubelmann dismissed any criticism of collaboration with the government of the Syrian president, Bashar . We were working pro bono, not for any government, but to help the archaeologists, he said. They shared their work with the Syrian archaeologists, he said, adding, We also train our colleagues so they can later do this on their own.  What is paramount is memory and potential restoration. In the last year, his team has flown drones over some 20 historic sites in Syria. Recently, it moved into zones in Iraq, close to the front line in the fight against the Islamic State. The team is now analyzing the wars effects on the remains of once thriving cities dating back some 3, 000 years, including Nineveh, Khorsabad and the thrashed temple and palace of Nimrud, where the government drove out the jihadists in November. In 2015, Islamists sent out videos showing militants using sledgehammers to break reliefs of human figures and mythical winged bulls as part of their campaign. Nimrud was probably the most splendid of the Assyrian cities, Layla Abdulkarim, a Syrian architect, said as she analyzed aerial photographs. Using drones in archaeological work is not entirely new, specialists say, but at a recent gathering in Paris researchers from Europe and the Middle East said they were now having to practice war archaeology, that is, collecting reliable data from areas. The images from the drones in war zones had proved immensely valuable. But these were barely scratching the surface. Before the war, close to 150 archaeological projects were underway, just in Syria, researchers said. Experts from many countries are trying to assess the damage in Syrias old cities but also in the area where the Islamic State held sway that is straddling Iraq and Syria, the region that is seen as central to human history and often called the birthplace of modern economics and writing. There is an outcry for data about the havoc wreaked in Yemen by Saudi bombing. People are exchanging satellite images and data on blogs and other research platforms, but we have no real assessment yet because so many ancient sites are not accessible, said Pascal Butterlin, a professor of archaeology at the Sorbonne in Paris. Time is of the essence, even in the case of ruins, Mr. Butterlin said. He has led expeditions for more than 20 years to Mari, near Syrias border with Iraq. Before fleeing, the guards at Mari reported that looters had come from Iraq, he said. We need to know what places need to be stabilized and how looters have altered the sites, he said. Important evidence, like clandestine pits, can disappear very quickly through sandstorms and erosion.  Cheikhmous Ali, a Syrian archaeologist based in France, who founded the international group the Association for the Protection of Syrian Archaeology, said reports of organized pillaging continued. A first wave of looting began in 2012, Mr. Ali said, and looting has accelerated since 2014 with the arrival of the Islamic State. While jihadists were more motivated to destroy the artifacts, they had also allowed looters to operate in exchange for money. Mr. Ali said he kept an ever changing tally of museums bombed, objects carted off, safes stolen. The exhibition in Paris, which is drawing large crowds, coincides with History Begins in Mesopotamia, a show at the Louvres regional museum in Lens. Both exhibitions highlight the French governments active concern about cultural damage in Syria, which was briefly controlled by France in the first half of the 20th century. Mr. Hollande has taken a strong interest, condemning the deliberate destruction of patrimony by all sides as war crimes.  This past month, France offered $30 million toward a proposed $100 million fund to protect sites as fighting abates, provide emergency storage for artifacts and eventually rehabilitate monuments. At the Eternal Sites opening at the Grand Palais, Mr. Hollande stressed that France was taking in more Syrian refugees trying to protect monuments of great historical and cultural importance did not mean ignoring the suffering of the population. Should we be concerned about the patrimony? he asked. What is more important, saving lives or saving stones? In reality, these two are inseparable. "
George Michaelâ€™s Freedom Video: An Oral History - The New York Times,New York Times,Guy Trebay and Jacob Bernstein,1/1/2017,2017,1,,"Pop music and fashion never met cuter than in George Michaels Freedom! 90 video. Sure, other catwalk favorites starred in music videos during that era, and fashion photographers like Steven Meisel and Herb Ritts were recruited by stars such as Madonna, Chris Isaak and Janet Jackson to burnish their visuals. But the convergence of a makers irresistible rhythms and lyrics, a group of models at the peak of their fame and a director on the verge of his own runaway success gave Freedom! 90 a jolt of stylish energy that has yet to fade after more than a . Directed by David Fincher, who was at the start of his film career, and filmed over several days at Merton Park Studios in London, the video from Mr. Michaels 1990 album, Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1, brought together five models Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford and Tatjana Patitz who were then the queens of fashion. It runs for six and a half minutes, and its production also gathered a team of novice professionals who would go on to become major forces in fashion, including the stylist Camilla Nickerson, the hairdresser Guido Palau, the makeup artist Carol Brown and the model John Pearson. Shot in moody, romantic tones, Freedom! 90 had been viewed more than 37 million times on YouTube by the time of Mr. Michaels unexpected death at 53 last Sunday. Reached by phone this week, some of the participants recalled their experiences on set, and some of the videos most ardent fans reflected on its impact. Naomi Campbell, model. Wed done a British Vogue cover with Peter Lindbergh with all of us. I met George in L. A. and he said: Ive been told that I need to speak to you to get the girls for the video. What would it take to get you? We were living in America, so I said youd have to fly us in, basically. I said yes, and then Christy and Tatjana and everyone came in. The night before the video, I didnt sleep at all, because we did five shows for Thierry Mugler in Paris. He had 76 models, and it was the big finale of him designing, although none of us knew that then. The last show finished at around 3 oclock in the morning, and George was there. So from there I went back to my hotel, packed my bags and went on the first flight to London. David Fincher knew exactly what he wanted. He didnt really give us parts, but he knew exactly which part of the song he wanted each and every one of us to sing. I was more the active one. Cindy was sultry. I dont think any of us knew what it would become. We knew the song was a hit, but we didnt know in any way what effect it would have in terms of videos, the way it would affect people. We were all really excited on the day it was going to be aired. They all had great premieres back in the day. They dont have them anymore. Not that Ive seen. MTVs changed. Hasnt it? I got to see George a little bit more after that because Kate Moss was neighbors with him. When we did the Olympics, he sang there in London. We all did the finale, and he was rehearsing and Kate and I went to watch him with this amazing choir singing Freedom.  After, he invited us all back to his home and he had this really nice in the garden, and we all got to light these wishing lanterns and we all did that together. Thats the memory Im going to keep. Guido Palau, hairdresser. I dont know how I got the job. George Michael and David Fincher had seen some of my work in British Vogue. It was a different time then. It was a big, big production, a video because they had to bring in all the girls. Every girl had a day, though Christy and Linda were there together. My part was to make the girls the best they could look as who they were. They werent playing characters. They were playing themselves. And each had their own personality: Linda the comedian, Christy much more classic, Cindy the pinup, Tatjana this kind of film noir, and Naomi a very strong kind of woman. We extracted that from them. They werent prodded at all, though there were some surprises, like Lindas hair, which shed done for a job for someone else. It wasnt like I said, Oh, dye your hair blond, not at all. At the time, we really didnt realize how iconic the video would become. I was probably a bit naÃ¯ve about the whole thing seeing how it was a bit of a job for me. What I remember most is the days being very long, and at the end of the day, the red wine would come out. There wed be in the location van drinking and singing with George. Tatjana Patitz, model. I was in my own zone. I had to kind of slide up and down the wall for part of the day. The feel of the set was so this big, loft kind of vibe. There was another setup with me laying on a chaise longue with a black smoking jacket. I think I may have had a bustier on. And I was smoking, even. People still smoked in videos then and even in films. George Michael wasnt on the set the day I was there, but Id met him a few times in L. A. Herb Ritts shot a cover of me and him for a magazine Im trying to remember what magazine it was. So many magazines have come and gone. Glamour was very present in fashion in those days, feminine glamour, people looking at inspiration from the movie stars of the 40s and 50s Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner. A lot of magazines were pairing models with pop stars or movie stars to shoot covers. It was very different those days. The business was much smaller and wasnt as saturated, not as fast as it is now. Models were known by their first names, and suddenly the glamour we embodied at that time crossed over to pop music videos and film. We were part of the entertainment industry, which made it really fun. George was very nice, almost a little shy. Maybe thats the wrong word. He was mellow and kind. I was quite at the time because I grew up with Wham and their music he was one of my first teenage crushes. In the five or so times I met him, he was always very pleasant and sweet but timid, not one of those vivacious, people who take a room by storm. I remember the shoot being in fall or early winter. I flew in on the Concorde for the day and flew back to New York right after that. Its funny. A lot of people were using models in videos then, but this one in particular stood the test of time. Its not like you look at Freedom! 90 now and say, Oh, my God, its so 80s! Its not like Working Girl.  John Pearson, model. My agent called up and said: Hey, do you want to do this video? All the big girls are doing it.  Of course I said yes. I was a big George Michael fan. I used to see him all the time in London at the clubs. I arrived at the studios at 3 oclock in the afternoon and met David Fincher briefly, and then basically sat around all day and watched while Christy and Linda were being shot. Theres one shot where Linda puts her head underneath her sweater thats amazing. That wasnt rehearsed. Linda really knows how to use her body to communicate in an elegant way, never cheap and tawdry. George was there, very warm and nice but very shy. The day went long, and the producer said at the end of the day, Can we shoot you tomorrow? I didnt have another job booked, so I said, Sure.  Then he said, Do you mind doing it for nothing? I said, No way.  It was a little bit bolshie of me, but I knew what the girls were getting. In the end, I was paid $15, 000 for the day, which is not bad to hang out with these fabulous, beautiful girls. But Id been working nonstop for three years, and I wasnt going to do it for free. And it turned out to be one of those fabulously easy, jobs, everyone riding on this wave of semistardom and recognition for the models. I really didnt realize how big it all was at the time. Candis Cayne, actress, model and former drag personality. There was a group of girls in N. Y. C. in the 90s, and we didnt want to model ourselves on anything other than the supermodels. Linda and Naomi and Christy. So when the video of Freedom! came out and they were all in it, we were obsessed. I used to do shows at Boy Bar, so I decided I was going to do Freedom! and got Lina and Mistress Formika and Sherry Vine to play the various parts. I was Linda. She was my favorite. We did the whole thing naked under white sheets. After the very last chorus, we dropped the sheets and were completely naked holding our groin areas. That song meant a lot to us. There were singers we knew were gay then, but no one really talked about it. We just grabbed onto songs and artists who knew who and what we were, whether it was Madonna with Vogue and Truth or Dare or George Michael with Freedom! I dont know if he was openly gay or not, then. I guess not. But it was almost O. K. because we all knew and it was such a homophobic time. It was so oppressive, particularly when you factor in the AIDS epidemic. To be open would have been a career killer. But going to a club, listening to Freedom! , it was an escape. Alan Hunter, one of the original MTV V. J. s. It was a funny moment in my life. I was driving my kid to day care on a day where I didnt know where my career had gone. Id left MTV. My agent wasnt calling. I was depressed. And I turned on the radio, and on came George Michaels new song. It was George Michael at the peak of his writing skills. It was such a brilliant capstone Id ever heard. It was his song. He was saying, Everything that brought me to pop stardom I now disavow.  Then I saw the video shortly thereafter with all that iconography hed used in his past, and he literally sets those things on fire and explodes them. The leather jacket hed worn and the jukebox from Faith.  And he just steps away. He wasnt even in the video. It showed how serious he was, even while he said it all with a lot of love. It was such a joyous song. I actually felt happy. Zac Posen, fashion designer. I was 10 years old, 10 or 11. Id see it in my living room waiting for Madonna to come on. I probably wanted to be the child in Open Your Heart.  But what I remember about Freedom! was that it was kind of a seminal predecessor to grunge. Because you have these incredibly glamorous beauties in a very industrial, Corinne Day, space. Theres water dripping down the walls and George Michaels leather jacket is on fire, and the models are naked. It was really the glamour of the 80s transitioning into something more raw that was to come."
"With New Congress Poised to Convene, Obamaâ€™s Policies Are in Peril - The New York Times",New York Times,Jennifer Steinhauer,1/2/2017,2017,1,,"WASHINGTON The most powerful and ambitious Congress in 20 years will convene Tuesday, with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of American life refashioning the countrys social safety net, wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the Obama administration. Even before Donald J. Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, giving their party full control of the government, Republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities most notably a measure to clear a path for the Affordable Care Acts repeal. Perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new Congress is the push for deregulation. Also up early: filling a Supreme Court seat, which is sure to set off a pitched showdown, and starting confirmation hearings for Mr. Trumps cabinet nominees. Its a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results, said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. And we intend to do it.  But as Republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of Congress for their more partisan goals, Democrats are preparing roadblocks. The partys brutal wounds have been salted by evidence of Russian election interference, Mr. Trumps cabinet picks and his taunting Twitter posts. (On Saturday, he offered New Years wishes to all, including those who have fought me and lost so badly they just dont know what to do. ) Obstacles will also come from Republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. Some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to Medicare, that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. And any burst of legislative action will come only if Congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock. For Republicans, the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved the House in particular has signaled the Republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. But many of those measures have gathered dust in the Senate or been doused in veto ink. The cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent House Republican majority in the . Speaker Newt Gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, who stacked conservative House bills like so many fire logs in the back of the Senate chamber. Theyve been given a golden opportunity here, said Trent Lott, the former Republican Senate majority leader. But I have watched over the years when one party has had control of the White House and the Senate and the House, and the danger is overplaying your hand. If you go too far, like what happened with Obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem, Mr. Lott continued. You have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you.  The tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation the Senate Finance Committee is already moving in that direction. Still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from Mr. Trumps chief of staff, Reince Priebus. The Senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the Democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for in two years in states that voted for Mr. Trump. Republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time. But on many issues, Senate Democrats including their new leader, Chuck Schumer of New York are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex Senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of Mr. Trumps agenda. After campaigning on a promise to help the middle class, Trumps postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after hes sworn in, said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. Democrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating families and the economy.  Republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules, many that President Obama has issued through the regulatory process, and they have been advising the Trump team on which ones should be undone. I hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else, the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said at a recent forum. I think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy.  In late December, the Obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in mining. That regulation, one of dozens that Mr. Trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. But Congress is likely to block it, using the obscure Congressional Review Act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 Senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules completion. Given time constraints on the Senate floor, members will have to pick some priorities. They are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources, and still others that restrict pesticide use. Republicans will also move quickly to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year already a quarter over that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any Democratic filibuster. But Republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace Mr. Obamas, and they may delay the repeal measures effective date for years. The Senate must also consider Mr. Trumps cabinet picks, and Senate Democrats are already trying to slow the process. However, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than Supreme Court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. Previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome. Democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with Mr. Trumps nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. Republicans have been particularly upset that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee or had meetings canceled. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California postponed her meeting with Mr. Sessions until January because, she said, her schedule got too busy. The senator doesnt want to rush, said her spokesman, Tom Mentzer. One reason that Democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over Mr. McConnells refusal last year to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland. Lingering in the background is the specter of Russia. Democrats and some Republicans, who are at odds with Mr. Trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. The Obama administration, which took sweeping steps last week to punish the Russians over election hacking, will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions. While Republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the partys leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that Americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well. This is no time for hubris, Mr. McConnell said. You have to perform. "
The Afghan War and the Evolution of Obama - The New York Times,New York Times,Mark Landler,1/17/2017,2017,1,,"WASHINGTON President Obamas advisers wrestled with an intractable problem in the spring and summer of 2015: How could they stabilize Afghanistan while preserving Mr. Obamas longtime goal of pulling out the last American troops before he left office? As it happened, the president solved the problem for them. In early August of that year, when Mr. Obama convened a meeting of the National Security Council, he looked around the table and acknowledged a stark new reality. The fever in this room has finally broken, the president told the group, according to a person in the meeting. Were no longer in mode.  What Mr. Obama meant was that no one in the Situation Room that day, himself included, thought that the United States after 14 years of war, billions of dollars spent and more than 2, 000 American lives lost would ever transform Afghanistan into a semblance of a democracy able to defend itself. At the same time, he added, the counterterrorism challenges are real.  As bleak as Afghanistans prospects were, the United States could not afford to walk away and allow the country to become a seedbed for extremists again. A few weeks later, the president halted the withdrawal and announced that he would leave thousands of American troops in the country indefinitely. It was a crucial turning point in the evolution of Barack Obama. The antiwar candidate of 2008 who had pledged to turn around Afghanistan the good war to George W. Bushs bad war in Iraq had conceded that the longest military operation in American history would not end on his watch. The optimistic president who once thought Afghanistan was winnable had, through bitter experience, become the commander in chief of a forever war. He remains defensive about the lessons of that journey. We shouldnt assume that every time a country has problems that it reflects a failure of American policy, the president said in an interview in September. Now, as Mr. Obama prepares to turn the war over to Donald J. Trump, a leader even more skeptical than he is about the value of American engagement in foreign conflicts, Afghanistan captures the disillusionment of a man who believed, as he put it in his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, that war is sometimes necessary, and war at some level is an expression of human folly.  More than any other conflict, Afghanistan shaped Mr. Obamas thinking on the basic questions of war, peace and the use of military power. It is where he discovered his affinity for drones, sharpened his belief in the limits of American intervention, battled his generals and hardened his disdain for unreliable foreign leaders. It reaffirmed his suspicions about sending American troops into foreign conflicts and made him reluctant to use more force in Iraq, Syria, Libya and other war zones. It also chastened him about his own hopes. When it comes to helping these societies stabilize and create a more secure environment and a better life for their people, we have to understand, he said in the interview, that this is a long slog.  Mr. Obama was a state senator from Illinois in October 2002 when he famously condemned Iraq as a dumb war.  But in the same speech he also said, I dont oppose all wars.  He was referring to Afghanistan, which he viewed as a just war to hunt down the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. I would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again, he told the crowd that day in Chicagos Federal Plaza. By July 2008, as the Democratic nominee for president, Mr. Obama had embraced Afghanistan as a priority over Iraq the good war, in a phrase that he never actually used himself but that became so associated with his approach it was sometimes wrongly attributed to him. Mr. Obama praised the Bush administrations troop surge in Iraq that year not because he believed that the United States could transform Iraqi society, but because he thought that reducing the violence there would allow the nation to turn its attention to Afghanistan. This is a war that we have to win, he declared. He promised to send at least two more combat brigades, or roughly 10, 000 soldiers, to Afghanistan. The United States was hardly on course for victory. Although there were already close to 50, 000 American troops in Afghanistan as Mr. Obama campaigned that summer, the Taliban were gaining momentum. In a bloody debacle, nine American soldiers were killed in what became known as the Battle of Wanat when the Taliban brazenly overran a remote Army outpost in the far eastern province of Nuristan. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, echoed Mr. Obama in calling the situation in the country precarious and urgent.  More than 100 Americans would die in Afghanistan by the end of 2008, a larger number than in any other prior year. When Mr. Obama took office in January 2009, he ordered a quick policy review on Afghanistan by a former intelligence analyst, Bruce Riedel. But even before it was completed, he accepted a Pentagon recommendation to send 17, 000 additional troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total to nearly 70, 000 American troops on the ground. By the fall of 2009, with the Taliban showing increased strength, Mr. Obamas military commanders, backed by the elders on his war council, including Hillary Clinton, then his secretary of state, were pressing him to go much farther. They urged on him an ambitious counterinsurgency strategy that had helped turn around the war in Iraq a expensive doctrine of trying to win over the locals by building roads, bridges, schools and a government. The strategy, known by its acronym COIN, would require as many as 40, 000 additional American men and women in uniform in Afghanistan, his advisers told him. There was still the afterglow of the surge in Iraq, and the counterinsurgency narrative that had made the military the savior of the Iraq war, said Vali R. Nasr, a former State Department adviser on Afghanistan and Pakistan. I dont believe Obama was in a position to pick a debate with the military on Afghanistan, and to assert what would be his worldview.  In many ways, I think, he deferred, said Mr. Nasr, now the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Although Mr. Obama agreed after months of internal debate to send 30, 000 additional troops to Afghanistan, he placed a strict timetable on the mission, saying they would have to be withdrawn again, starting in July 2011. His aides later said he felt hijacked by a military that had presented him with a narrow band of options rather than a real choice. Even some former military commanders agreed, saying that the troop deployments were framed in a way that made choosing a smaller number 20, 000, for example look like a path to certain defeat. President Obama was asking the military for broad options, said Karl W. Eikenberry, a retired general who served as the commander in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007 and was later Mr. Obamas ambassador to Kabul. But, he said, the military gave Mr. Obama only variations on the more robust counterinsurgency model.  Mr. Eikenberry, who wrote a politically explosive but prescient cable in late 2009 raising doubts about the wisdom of the surge, diagnosed a deeper problem with the policy. Was it simply to prevent Afghanistan from being a safe haven for Al Qaeda? Or was it to turn Afghanistan into another Denmark? When he came in, everyone knew we were going to do more, Mr. Eikenberry said. But what we were trying to achieve was difficult to define.  Given Mr. Obamas innate wariness of it didnt take long for him to grow disenchanted with the Denmark option. A few months into the surge, in the spring of 2010, David H. Petraeus, the commander of the Pentagons Central Command and an architect of the strategy, was briefing him on the state of the counterinsurgency campaign. Drawing on anthropology theory from the University of Chicago, General Petraeus explained to his commander in chief how neighborhoods in Kandahar related to one another. Mr. Obama listened for a while, then cut him off. We cant worry about how neighborhoods relate to each other in Kandahar, he curtly told General Petraeus, according to people in the room. Obama believes the military can do enormous things, said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser. It can win wars and stabilize conflicts. But a military cant create a political culture or build a society.  By the end of his first term, Mr. Obama had evolved to the point that he fully embraced the concept Afghan good enough.  The phrase, which had been kicked around the White House since 2010, referred to the shift away from to a policy that was content with taking out the terrorists, preventing the Taliban from overrunning the country and putting a premium on getting the troops out. By that new standard, things had improved in Afghanistan. By August 2010, 100, 000 American troops were on the ground in Afghanistan and were pushing back the Taliban in some critical areas. Despite uneven progress in the military campaign, Ryan Crocker, a diplomat who had reopened the American Embassy in Kabul in 2002 and served there again as ambassador in 2011, recalled thinking, Wow, this place looks great! The Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May 2011 added to Mr. Obamas conviction that he was on the way to closing the books on the war. At midnight on May 1, 2012, Air Force One rolled out from behind a hangar at Joint Base Andrews to pick up the president for a secret trip to Afghanistan. He was going to sign a strategic partnership agreement with President Hamid Karzai that set the terms for relations after 2014, when the United States was scheduled to withdraw its combat troops and turn over Afghanistans security to the Afghans. Aides to Mr. Obama had advised him not to go for security reasons, but he saw it as an important milestone. The agreement promised an enduring partnership between the United States and Afghanistan, with pledges of American help in developing the Afghan economy and public institutions. Yet the promises obscured a starker reality: Mr. Obama had accelerated the timetable for drawing down American troops, and he was looking beyond the war. Speaking to a national TV audience from Bagram Air Base, he suggested that Americas experience in Afghanistan had come full circle. One year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden, he said. The goal I set to defeat Al Qaeda, and deny it a chance to rebuild is now within our reach.  Earlier, Mr. Obama had met for an hour with Mr. Karzai. The two had long had a rocky relationship on an earlier trip, Mr. Obama excoriated Mr. Karzai for the rampant corruption in the Afghan government and this session did little to improve their rapport. Mr. Crocker recalled that the president was very aloof, almost cold, which bothered me a bit because Id worked a solid damn year to get Karzai in a better place with us.  Things never warmed up between them. When Mr. Karzai refused to sign a security agreement with Washington, Mr. Obama gave up on him to focus on his successor, Ashraf Ghani. The experience left a lasting imprint on the president, his aides said. He concluded that without the right partner, it was impossible for the United States to succeed, no matter how much blood and treasure it poured into a country. It was an insight that Mr. Obama applied to his relations with other countries, from Pakistan to Israel, where his poor relationships with the leaders impeded progress. The most underappreciated part of foreign policy, Mr. Rhodes said, is dealing with flawed partners.  When Mr. Obama convened his National Security Council that day in August 2015, the Taliban were regrouping again. They had carried out audacious terrorist attacks in the center of Kabul and had mounted a military offensive in the provinces of Kunduz and Oruzgan. Worse, there was a new threat in the form of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which sprouted in the poisonous soil of Iraq after the United States left and was finding recruits in the Hindu Kush. Mr. Obama had rejected a chorus of calls in Washington to delay the drawdown, under which the residual force of American troops was to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2016. The mantra I heard was that the president does not want to hand off to his successor the mess he inherited, said Daniel F. Feldman, who served as the special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2014 and 2015. But as the Islamic State became a dire enough threat to return American troops to Iraq, Mr. Obama felt compelled to change course on Afghanistan. ISIL thrived in a vacuum in Iraq and it pointed to a similar vacuum in Afghanistan, Mr. Rhodes said. Mr. Obama, he said, was prodded by more than fear. After a long stretch of political paralysis, Afghanistan formed a government with Mr. Ghani in the presidency. For the first time since taking office, Mr. Obama felt like he had a partner with whom he could do business. The Afghan Army was taking heavy casualties fighting the Taliban, and the president believed that the United States had an obligation to help them. But as Mr. Obamas war council met that August morning, the level of American support remained the subject of intense debate. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. a skeptic about Afghanistan going back to 2009, argued that the country would revert to chaos, regardless of how long the United States stayed there. It doesnt matter if we leave tomorrow or 10 years from now, he declared, according to those in the room. He was, he conceded, a broken record on this issue. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, who had succeeded Admiral Mullen as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommended that the United States maintain a military presence in Kabul, and at Bagram and a scattering of bases in the east and south. The 10, 000 soldiers in the country would carry out a singular, ruthless mission of killing suspected terrorists and keeping the country from spiraling out of control. The imperative, General Dempsey told Mr. Obama, was that Afghanistan fit into a broader counterterrorism policy from Central Asia to North Africa to extend well beyond your presidency, according to several officials. Mr. Obama liked that idea. It was in line, he said, with the principles he had laid out in a 2014 speech at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N. Y. where he said America would train and equip foreign armies but leave the fighting to them. He acknowledged that it would mean handing off Afghanistan to his successor as unfinished business. This goes to the politics of what Im leaving for the next president, he told the group, according to one of the participants. My interest is not to sign them up for 10 years of X, he added, referring to troop numbers, but to lay out a vision and to put stakes in the ground for that vision.  Mr. Obama now seems at an uneasy peace. In the interview in September, he disputed the suggestion that his policy had failed. He had, after all, reduced the number of American troops to fewer than 10, 000 from more than 100, 000. They were training and assisting Afghan troops, even if the line between that and actual combat was sometimes blurry. The country had been broken to begin with, he said, and America was never going to fix it. Afghanistan was one of the poorest countries in the world with the lowest literacy rates in the world before we got there. It continues to be, Mr. Obama said. The country was riven with all kinds of ethnic and tribal divisions before we got there. Its still there.  In the end, Afghanistan became the template for a new kind of warfare a chronic conflict, across an arc of unstable states, in which the United States is a participant, if not the principal actor. At a NATO summit meeting in Warsaw in July, Mr. Obama acknowledged that this prospect would disappoint an American public still suffering from combat fatigue. Its very hard for us ever to get the satisfaction of MacArthur and the emperor meeting, and a war being officially over, he said. As commander in chief of the most powerful military in the world, he went on, I spend a lot of time brooding over these issues. And Im not satisfied weve got it perfect yet. "
Benjamin Netanyahu Questioned in Israel Graft Inquiry - The New York Times,New York Times,Isabel Kershner,1/3/2017,2017,1,,"JERUSALEM Israeli police investigators questioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for three hours at his official residence on Monday evening on suspicion of receiving illicit gifts and favors from business executives. Mr. Netanyahu was questioned under caution, the police said in a statement, implying that there were grounds to suspect that Mr. Netanyahu might have committed a criminal offense. No further details can be given at this stage, the statement added. The Ministry of Justice said late Monday that Mr. Netanyahu had been questioned by investigators from Lahav 433, a police fraud investigation and prosecution unit, with the authorization of the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit. In a detailed statement, the ministry described how the police had gathered testimony from dozens of witnesses, some abroad, and seized documents during a monthslong graft inquiry. While some aspects of the inquiry did not yield evidence of crimes, the statement said, other parts warranted a deeper investigation. Mr. Netanyahu, who has been subject to police inquiries and investigations in the past that ended without charges, has vehemently denied any impropriety. This will all come to nothing, because there is nothing, he has said repeatedly of the latest accusations. Local news outlets say the investigators are focused on two separate cases, one more serious than the other, but they have offered little detail on the more serious one. The less weighty one, according to reports in the newspaper Haaretz and other outlets, concerns favors for Mr. Netanyahu, and possibly for members of his family, given by Israeli and foreign business executives. The Israeli police took testimony from Ronald S. Lauder, a conservative American businessman and philanthropist, and a close friend of Mr. Netanyahus, when he came to Israel in late September to attend the funeral of Shimon Peres, the former prime minister and president. Upon Mr. Lauders arrival in Israel, he was asked to meet with the Israeli police and respond to questions related to an investigation, to which Mr. Lauder is not a party, Helena Beilin, a Tel lawyer representing Mr. Lauder, said in a statement. After a short meeting the following day, he was told that his presence was no longer needed and that there would be no need for additional meetings. This remains the case.  Mr. Netanyahus office, suggesting that he is the victim of a witch hunt, issued a statement over the weekend berating the news organizations for what it described as premature and politically motivated reports. Try to replace the prime minister at the ballot boxes, as is accepted in democracies, it added. In televised remarks on Monday afternoon, Mr. Netanyahu told legislators from his conservative Likud Party in Parliament, We hear the celebratory spirit and winds blowing through the television studios and in the corridors of the opposition.  Hold off the celebrations dont rush, he added. Ive told you before and will tell you again this will come to nothing, because there is nothing.  Mr. Netanyahu is serving his third consecutive term in office, and his fourth over all. He has exuded confidence lately, lashing out at journalists who have been critical of him, talking up Israels diplomatic and economic achievements, and calling in the United States ambassador to Israel, Daniel B. Shapiro, for a dressing down late last month after the Obama administration decided not to use its veto to shield Israel from a United Nations Security Council resolution that condemned Israeli settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Mr. Netanyahu, generally a popular prime minister, has developed a combative relationship with the local mainstream news media. After years of tension with the Obama administration, he also appears buoyed by the prospect of a partnership with Donald J. Trump, who seems more sympathetic to Israeli government policies on issues like settlements. For Mr. Netanyahus opponents, the prospect of a possible indictment has provided a glimmer of hope, even though elections are not scheduled until late 2019. This creates an unusual dynamic in Israeli politics, said Nahum Barnea, a political columnist for the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth and a critic of Mr. Netanyahu. On the one hand, Mr. Barnea said, there were already signs that Netanyahu loyalists would try to promote legislation banning investigations of sitting prime ministers. On the other, he said, the question of who might succeed Mr. Netanyahu, who has no natural heir in his party, was bound to be raised. Opposition leaders were fairly subdued in their initial response. Isaac Herzog, the leader of the Zionist Union and of the opposition in Parliament, said it was a tough day for Israel when a prime minister is under investigation.  He added, We are not expressing satisfaction at anothers misfortune.  Mr. Herzog has also been the subject of police investigations over campaign funding. Yair Lapid, the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, which has challenged Likud in recent polls, said, The presumption of innocence applies to every Israeli, including the prime minister.  He called for a swift investigation for the sake of the country, saying, A person who is being investigated is a person under pressure.  Israeli prime ministers are not obligated to step down while under investigation, unless they are charged with a crime. Nonetheless, the accusations could chip away at Mr. Netanyahus standing. His predecessor, Ehud Olmert, was forced from power in 2008 under the weight of police investigations and accusations of corruption, although he remained in office as a caretaker prime minister until early elections could be held in 2009. In February, Mr. Olmert became the first former Israeli prime minister to enter prison. He is serving a term for bribery and obstruction of justice. Mr. Netanyahu described Mr. Olmert in 2008 as a prime minister up to his neck in investigations and said he could not be trusted to make fateful decisions under the circumstances because they might be based on personal rather than national interests. Since the 1990s, Mr. Netanyahus political career has been dogged by inquiries into his conduct, and that of people around him, though no charges have been filed against him. The inquiries have ranged from scandals involving travel expenses and garden furniture the Netanyahus were suspected of having switched a new set bought for the prime ministers official residence with an identical, old set in their private home in Caesarea to a more recent one involving a deal with Germany for the acquisition of submarines. That agreement came under scrutiny after it became known that Mr. Netanyahus personal lawyer also represents the Israeli agent of the German shipyard that builds the submarines, and other naval equipment purchased by Israel, giving rise to suspicion of a conflict of interest. In that episode, too, Mr. Netanyahu and the lawyer, David Shimron, have denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Netanyahus relationship with Arnaud Mimran, a French tycoon who was convicted of fraud last year, and who testified that he had contributed a large sum of money to Mr. Netanyahu for his 2009 election campaign, has also prompted suspicions of impropriety."
"Airline Pilot, Believed to Be Drunk, Is Pulled From Cockpit in Canada - The New York Times",New York Times,Ian Austen,1/3/2017,2017,1,,"OTTAWA It was 7 a. m. and 99 passengers and six crew members were aboard a 737 on the tarmac at Calgary International Airport, bound for a sunny holiday in Cancun, Mexico. There was one problem, however. The flights captain was passed out in the cockpit, apparently from drinking. The police in Calgary, Alberta, arrested the pilot, Miroslav Gronych, 37, on Saturday and have charged him with two offenses. This is a new one, and obviously this had a very significant potential to cause great harm had the pilot actually been allowed to fly this plane, Staff Sgt. Paul Stacey of the Calgary Police Service said at a news conference. Theres just so many checks and balances, it just doesnt surprise me that he got caught before this plane was able to leave the gate.  Nevertheless, Inspector Ken Thrower, the commander of the Calgary Police Services traffic and airport unit, said his officers, along with airport officials and inspectors from Transport Canada, the aviation regulator, will begin trying to figure out how the pilot managed to pass through several checkpoints, including airport security, while obviously inebriated. Mr. Gronych was charged with two criminal offenses: having care and control of an aircraft while impaired, and having care and control of an aircraft while testing for more than 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. He was pretty high, Sergeant Stacey said, adding that it was inconceivable that the pilot had followed Transport Canada regulations that bar drinking or drug use by pilots within eight hours of a flight. The aircraft was operated by Sunwing Airlines, a carrier based in Toronto. Sunwings gate agents found the pilots behavior to be unusual and alerted the . The then discovered the pilot slumped in the captains seat and severely impaired by alcohol, Sergeant Stacey said. Transport Canada, which did not respond to requests for comment, is conducting a separate investigation, which is likely to result in additional charges, the police said. Inspector Thrower said Mr. Gronych is from Slovenia and is in Canada on a work visa. He will appear in court again on Thursday. After some delay, the flight did take off with a new crew. Sunwing did not respond to requests for comment. Janine Massey, a spokeswoman, told The Associated Press that the carrier was very apologetic for any upset that this has caused and would like to assure our customers that safety remains our utmost priority.
