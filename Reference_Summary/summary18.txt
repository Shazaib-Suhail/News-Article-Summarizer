Speaker Newt Gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, who stacked conservative House bills like so many fire logs in the back of the Senate chamber.
The Senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the Democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for in two years in states that voted for Mr. Trump.
On many issues, Senate Democrats including their new leader, Chuck Schumer of New York are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex Senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of Mr. Trumps agenda.
The Senate must also consider Mr. Trumps cabinet picks, and Senate Democrats are already trying to slow the process.
Republicans have been particularly upset that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee or had meetings canceled.
