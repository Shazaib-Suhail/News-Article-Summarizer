Directed by David Fincher, who was at the start of his film career, and filmed over several days at Merton Park Studios in London, the video from Mr. Michaels 1990 album, Listen Without Prejudice Vol. People still smoked in videos then and even in films.
George Michael wasnt on the set the day I was there, but Id met him a few times in L. A. Herb Ritts shot a cover of me and him for a magazine Im trying to remember what magazine it was.
Models were known by their first names, and suddenly the glamour we embodied at that time crossed over to pop music videos and film.
A lot of people were using models in videos then, but this one in particular stood the test of time.
It was a little bit bolshie of me, but I knew what the girls were getting.
In the end, I was paid $15, 000 for the day, which is not bad to hang out with these fabulous, beautiful girls.
