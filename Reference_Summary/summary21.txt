The flights captain was passed out in the cockpit, apparently from drinking.
The police in Calgary, Alberta, arrested the pilot, Miroslav Gronych, 37, on Saturday and have charged him with two offenses.
This is a new one, and obviously this had a very significant potential to cause great harm had the pilot actually been allowed to fly this plane, Staff Sgt. Paul Stacey of the Calgary Police Service said at a news conference.
Nevertheless, Inspector Ken Thrower, the commander of the Calgary Police Services traffic and airport unit, said his officers, along with airport officials and inspectors from Transport Canada, the aviation regulator, will begin trying to figure out how the pilot managed to pass through several checkpoints, including airport security, while obviously inebriated.
He was pretty high, Sergeant Stacey said, adding that it was inconceivable that the pilot had followed Transport Canada regulations that bar drinking or drug use by pilots within eight hours of a flight.
