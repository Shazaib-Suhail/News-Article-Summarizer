Angels are everywhere in the Muiz familys apartment in the Bronx: paintings of angels on the wall, ceramic angels flanking the ancient VCR, angels strumming lyres or blowing little golden trumpets on the bathroom shelves.
As Jos A and Zoraida Muiz and their children have struggled to deal with a series of trials and setbacks, including cancer, debilitating epilepsy, deep depression and near eviction, it has sometimes seemed as if angels and love were the only forces holding things together.
When they operated on my son, they told me he was an angel, because he was supposed to die, Ms. Muiz, 50, said.
All the angels are gifts from friends and relatives, or picked up off the street, just like all the furniture in the Muizes overstuffed apartment in a complex on Westchester Avenue in the Bronx, much of it restored by Ms. Muiz.
It was around this time that Ms. Muiz got in touch with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Timess Neediest Cases Fund.
