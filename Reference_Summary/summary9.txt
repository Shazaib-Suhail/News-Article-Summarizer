The Second Avenue subway opened in New York City on Sunday, with thousands of riders flooding into its polished stations to witness a piece of history nearly a century in the making.
They descended beneath the streets of the Upper East Side of Manhattan to board Q trains bound for Coney Island in Brooklyn.
The opening of a new subway line is a rare occasion in the United States and comes at a time of mounting concern about the deteriorating state of the nations infrastructure, from its roadways and bridges to its public transit systems.
Few new subway stations have opened in recent years, even as expansive subway networks have sprouted in Asia, and most American cities never built any in the first place.
The arrival of the Second Avenue subway, which was first proposed in the 1920s, was a notable achievement for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the citys vast network of subways, buses and commuter railroads.
With the opening, the map of the citys loved and loathed subway adds three new stations, bringing the total to 472 the most of any subway in the world.
A station that opened at Hudson Yards on Manhattans Far West Side in 2015 was the citys first new station.
