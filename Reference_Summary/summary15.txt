On Sunday, a dispute erupted between Ms. Careys representatives and producers of ABCs Dick Clarks New Years Rockin Eve With Ryan Seacrest, on which the singer was performing.
Ms. Careys manager, Stella Bulochnikov, charged that the shows producers had been aware of technical problems but did not fix them and chose to continue showing Ms. Careys messy performance to get ratings.
Dick Clark Productions, which produced the show, issued a statement on Sunday night saying that Ms. Careys performance woes had nothing to do with the production, and that any suggestion that the company would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd.
In very rare instances, there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television, the statement said, adding that an initial investigation suggested that the production company had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Careys New Years Eve performance.
Ms. Carey, a pop phenomenon in the 1990s who won five Grammys out of 34 nominations over the years, was the final act on ABCs Dick Clarks New Years Rockin Eve With Ryan Seacrest.
After the performance, Ms. Carey posted a mildly profane slang phrase on Twitter with an upset emoji, then wrote: Have a happy and healthy new year everybody!
