The incoming Trump administration could choose to no longer defend the executive branch against the suit, which challenges the administrations authority to spend billions of dollars on health insurance subsidies for and Americans, handing House Republicans a big victory on issues.
Anticipating that the Trump administration might not be inclined to mount a vigorous fight against the House Republicans given the s dim view of the health care law, a team of lawyers this month sought to intervene in the case on behalf of two participants in the health care program.
In their request, the lawyers predicted that a deal between House Republicans and the new administration to dismiss or settle the case will produce devastating consequences for the individuals who receive these reductions, as well as for the nations health insurance and health care systems generally.
In the suit, which was initially championed by John A. Boehner, the House speaker at the time, and later in House committee reports, Republicans asserted that the administration, desperate for the funding, had required the Treasury Department to provide it despite widespread internal skepticism that the spending was proper.
It is a complicated set of dynamics illustrating how a quick legal victory for the House in the Trump era might come with costs that Republicans never anticipated when they took on the Obama White House.
