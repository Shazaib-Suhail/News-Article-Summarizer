PARIS When the Islamic State was about to be driven out of the ancient city of Palmyra in March, Yves Ubelmann got a call from Syrias director of antiquities to come over in a hurry.
Besides images from Palmyra, the multimedia show projects enormous photographs and videos, immersing visitors in different eras, including the ancient Iraqi city of Khorsabad around 700 B. C. an mosque in Damascus and a medieval Christian citadel.
Mr. Ubelmann dismissed any criticism of collaboration with the government of the Syrian president, Bashar.
Experts from many countries are trying to assess the damage in Syrias old cities but also in the area where the Islamic State held sway that is straddling Iraq and Syria, the region that is seen as central to human history and often called the birthplace of modern economics and writing.
There is an outcry for data about the havoc wreaked in Yemen by Saudi bombing.
People are exchanging satellite images and data on blogs and other research platforms, but we have no real assessment yet because so many ancient sites are not accessible, said Pascal Butterlin, a professor of archaeology at the Sorbonne in Paris.
Cheikhmous Ali, a Syrian archaeologist based in France, who founded the international group the Association for the Protection of Syrian Archaeology, said reports of organized pillaging continued.
At the Eternal Sites opening at the Grand Palais, Mr. Hollande stressed that France was taking in more Syrian refugees trying to protect monuments of great historical and cultural importance did not mean ignoring the suffering of the population.
