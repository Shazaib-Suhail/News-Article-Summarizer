You can choose a glossy or matte finish, print a photo on canvas, or make it into a poster with a few clicks online at photo sites like Snapfish and Shutterfly, professional photo shops like Adorama and Mpix, or drugstores and chains like Walgreens and Costco.
Snap Box is a site with clear instructions and pricing.
In addition to fabric posters, it also offers fine art prints, photo books and prints on canvas and pillows.
Photo Barn will also print your photos on canvas, burlap, and other wood products, like ornaments.
The company will scan about 1, 800 photos at 300 dpi for $145 at its headquarters in Irvine, Calif. the cost of sending the photo box to you, as well as the shipping of the box to Scan My Photos and back to you again is included in the price.
I asked a photo editor at The Times if 300 dpi is sufficient for scanning and she said that to print photos at larger sizes, a higher dpi is preferable.
