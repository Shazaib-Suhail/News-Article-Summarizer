Mr. Roof, who also faces a death penalty trial in state court, has not publicly explained his reasoning.
But legal filings strongly suggest a split with his defenders about whether to argue that his rampage resulted from mental illness.
If the jury views Roof as evil and having made a knowing, intelligent choice to kill these innocent, churchgoing people in order to foment racial hatred, they are much more likely to impose the death penalty than if they believe him to be a young and severely mentally ill person who acted under delusional racist beliefs, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a research group.
Its going to be extremely emotional, powerful testimony, said John H. Blume, a death penalty expert who teaches at Cornell Law School, and that emotion could implicitly and misleadingly indicate to the jury that some of these people want the death penalty when its not the case.
Among the issues could be the composition of the jury, given that Mr. Roof acted rather passively as his own lawyer when it was selected the withholding of evidence on mental health and other mitigating factors and Mr. Roofs competence to stand trial and to represent himself.
Mr. Bruck and his team have argued in court filings that Mr. Roof, a dropout, has no right to represent himself in a capital trial, and even less so at the penalty phase.
