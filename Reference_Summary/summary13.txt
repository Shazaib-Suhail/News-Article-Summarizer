Mr. Boxshall said much of the waste had been washed down the Yarra River that runs through Melbourne into Port Phillip, affecting the citys bayside beaches the most.
I was going to take my two young boys to the beach myself over the summer, but now Im concerned about whether the water is clean.
Mr. Boxshall said any improvement in the beaches water quality was uncertain as long as the rain continued.
