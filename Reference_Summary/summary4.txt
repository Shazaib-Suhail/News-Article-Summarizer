SEOUL, South Korea North Koreas leader, Kim said on Sunday that his country was making final preparations to conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile a bold statement less than a month before the inauguration of Donald J. Trump.
Although North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests in the last decade and more than 20 ballistic missile tests in 2016 alone, and although it habitually threatens to attack the United States with nuclear weapons, the country has never an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. In his annual New Years Day speech, which was broadcast on the Norths KCTV on Sunday, Mr. Kim spoke proudly of the strides he said his country had made in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
He said North Korea would continue to bolster its weapons programs as long as the United States remained hostile and continued its joint military exercises with South Korea.
If North Korea conducts a test in coming months, it will test Mr. Trumps new administration despite years of increasingly harsh sanctions, North Korea has been advancing toward Mr. Kims professed goal of arming his isolated country with the ability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States.
North Korea has deployed Rodong ballistic missiles that can reach most of South Korea and Japan, but it has had a spotty record in the Musudan, its ballistic missile with a range long enough to reach American military bases in the Pacific, including those on Guam.
