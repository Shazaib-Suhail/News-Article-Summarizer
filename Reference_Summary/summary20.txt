JERUSALEM Israeli police investigators questioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for three hours at his official residence on Monday evening on suspicion of receiving illicit gifts and favors from business executives.
Mr. Netanyahu was questioned under caution, the police said in a statement, implying that there were grounds to suspect that Mr. Netanyahu might have committed a criminal offense.
The Ministry of Justice said late Monday that Mr. Netanyahu had been questioned by investigators from Lahav 433, a police fraud investigation and prosecution unit, with the authorization of the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit.
The Israeli police took testimony from Ronald S. Lauder, a conservative American businessman and philanthropist, and a close friend of Mr. Netanyahus, when he came to Israel in late September to attend the funeral of Shimon Peres, the former prime minister and president.
Nonetheless, the accusations could chip away at Mr. Netanyahus standing.
His predecessor, Ehud Olmert, was forced from power in 2008 under the weight of police investigations and accusations of corruption, although he remained in office as a caretaker prime minister until early elections could be held in 2009.
