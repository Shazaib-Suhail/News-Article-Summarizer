With Donald J. Trump about to take control of the White House, it would seem a dark time for the renewable energy industry.
After all, Mr. Trump has mocked the science of global warming as a Chinese hoax, threatened to kill a global deal on climate change and promised to restore the coal industry to its former glory.
We do not know for sure that the New York wind farm will get built, but we do know this: The energy transition is real, and Mr. Trump is not going to stop it.
For starters, when Mr. Trump gets to the White House, he will find that the federal government actually has relatively little control over American energy policy, and particularly over electricity generation.
If Mr. Trump pushes for an early end to the subsidies, he will find that renewable energy has friends in the Republican Party.
