BAGHDAD A suicide bomber detonated a pickup truck loaded with explosives on Monday in a busy Baghdad market, killing at least 36 people hours after President Fran A ois Hollande of France arrived in the Iraqi capital.
The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a website that is often used by the group.
It was the third such attack in three days in or near Baghdad, underscoring the lingering threat posed by the extremist group despite a string of setbacks for it elsewhere in the country over the past year, including in and around the northern city of Mosul.
France is part of the coalition formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State after the extremist group seized large areas in Iraq and neighboring Syria.
France has suffered multiple attacks claimed by the extremist group.
