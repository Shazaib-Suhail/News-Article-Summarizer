F. C. North bragging rights, and a home game in the first round of the playoffs, were sufficient motivation for Green Bay to push hard enough to secure the teams sixth consecutive win and the third consecutive loss for Detroit.
Pundits had spent the week deciphering all of the wild scenarios that could play out for positioning among the remaining teams.

Eastern SUNDAY on Fox Thanks to playing in the N. F. C. East, home of the Dallas Cowboys, the Giants managed to tie Atlanta for the record in the N. F. C. but got stuck with the No. 5 seed in the playoffs and a road game against a Packers squad that won its final six games.
The good news for the Giants is that superstitious fans will note that the last two times they played the Packers on the road in the playoffs, they not only won the games but went on to win the Super Bowl both times.
